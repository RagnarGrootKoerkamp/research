  abstract =     {We present an algorithm for the optimal alignment of sequences
                  to genome graphs. It works by phrasing the edit distance
                  minimization task as finding a shortest path on an implicit
                  alignment graph. To find a shortest path, we instantiate the
                  A* paradigm with a novel domain-specific heuristic function
                  that accounts for the upcoming subsequence in the query to be
                  aligned, resulting in a provably optimal alignment algorithm
                  called AStarix.Experimental evaluation of AStarix shows that
                  it is 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude faster than
                  state-of-the-art optimal algorithms on the task of aligning
                  Illumina reads to reference genome graphs. Implementations and

  abstract =     {We present a novel A* seed heuristic enabling fast and optimal
                  sequence-to-graph alignment, guaranteed to minimize the edit
                  distance of the alignment assuming non-negative edit costs. We
                  phrase optimal alignment as a shortest path problem and solve
                  it by instantiating the A* algorithm with our novel seed
                  heuristic. The key idea of the seed heuristic is to extract
                  seeds from the read, locate them in the reference, mark
                  preceding reference positions by crumbs, and use the crumbs to
                  direct the A\textasteriskcentered search. We prove
                  admissibility of the seed heuristic, thus guaranteeing
                  alignment optimality. Our implementation extends the free and
                  open source AStarix aligner and demonstrates that the seed
                  heuristic outperforms all state-of-the-art optimal aligners
                  including Graphaligner, Vargas, PaSGAL, and the prefix
                  heuristic previously employed by AStarix. Specifically, we
                  achieve a consistent speedup of \&gt;60{\texttimes} on both
                  short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads (up to 25kbp), on
                  both the E. coli linear reference genome (lMbp) and the MHC
                  variant graph (5Mbp). Our speedup is enabled by the seed
                  heuristic consistently skipping \&gt;99.99\% of the table
                  cells that optimal aligners based on dynamic programming

  abstract =     "{Pairwise alignment of sequences is a fundamental method in
                  modern molecular biology, implemented within multiple
                  bioinformatics tools and libraries. Current advances in
                  sequencing technologies press for the development of faster
                  pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing
                  read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present
                  the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine
                  algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between
                  the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed
                  to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in
                  quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to
                  the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2)
                  memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data
                  dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the
                  automatic features of modern compilers, for different
                  architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate
                  the performance of our algorithm, together with other
                  state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate
                  that the WFA runs 20–300\texttimes{} faster than other methods
                  aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10–100\texttimes{}
                  faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford
                  Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within
                  the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at

                  as the minimum cost of a sequence of editing operations which
                  transforms one string into the other. The operations we admit
                  are deleting, inserting and replacing one symbol at a time,
                  with possibly different costs for each of these operations.
                  The problem of finding the longest common subsequence of two
                  strings is a special case of the problem of computing edit
                  distances. We describe an algorithm for computing the edit
                  distance between two strings of length n and m, n
                  \eqslantgtr{} m, which requires O(n \cdot{} max(1, mlog n))
                  steps whenever the costs of edit operations are integral
                  multiples of a single positive real number and the alphabet
                  for the strings is finite. These conditions are necessary for
                  the algorithm to achieve the time bound.}

  abstract =     {Finding the lowest-cost path through a graph is central to
                  many problems including route planning for a mobile robot If
                  arc costs change during the traverse then the remainder of the
                  path may need to be replanned. This is the case for a
                  sensor-equipped mobile robot with imperfect information about
                  its environment. As the robot acquires additional information
                  via its sensors it can revise its plan to reduce the total
                  cost of the traverse. If the prior information is grossly
                  incomplete the robot may discover useful information in every
                  piece of sensor data. During replanning, the robot must either
                  wait for the new path to be computed or move in the wrong
                  direction therefore rapid replanning is essential The D*
                  algorithm (Dynamic A*) plans optimal traverses ID real-time by
                  incrementally repairing paths to the robots state as new
                  information is discovered. This paper describes an extension
                  to D\textasteriskcentered that focusses the repairs to
                  significantly reduce the total time required for the initial
                  path calculation and subsequent replanning operations. This
                  extension completes the development of the
                  D\textasteriskcentered algorithm as a full generalizatin of
                  A\textasteriskcentered for dynamic environments where arc
                  costs can change during the traverse of the solution path.},

                  Adaptive A* is a recent incremental heuristic search algorithm
                  that solves series of similar search problems faster than A*
                  because it updates the h-values using information from
                  previous searches. It basically transforms consistent h-values
                  into more informed consistent h-values. This allows it to find
                  shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can
                  increase over time since consistent h-values remain consistent
                  after action cost increases. However, it is not guaranteed to
                  find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can
                  decrease over time because consistent h-values do not
                  necessarily remain consistent after action cost decreases.
                  Thus, the h-values need to get corrected after action cost
                  decreases. In this paper, we show how to do that, resulting in
                  Generalized Adaptive A\textasteriskcentered
                  (GAA\textasteriskcentered) that finds shortest paths in state
                  spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over
                  time. Our experiments demonstrate that Generalized Adaptive
                  A\textasteriskcentered outperforms breadth-first search,
                  A\textasteriskcentered and D\textasteriskcentered Lite for
                  moving-target search, where D\textasteriskcentered Lite is an
                  alternative state-of-the-art incremental heuristic search
                  algorithm that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the
                  action costs can increase or decrease over time.},

                  find solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster
                  than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. In
                  this paper, we apply Lifelong Planning A* to robot navigation
                  in unknown terrain, including goal-directed navigation in
                  unknown terrain and mapping of unknown terrain. The resulting
                  D* Lite algorithm is easy to understand and analyze. It
                  implements the same behavior as Stentz' Focussed Dynamic
                  A\textasteriskcentered but is algorithmically different. We
                  prove properties about D\textasteriskcentered Lite and
                  demonstrate experimentally the advantages of combining
                  incremental and heuristic search for the applications studied.
                  We believe that these results provide a strong foundation for
                  further research on fast replanning methods in artificial

                  based on the Shift-Or algorithm (Baeza-Yates \& Gonnet, 1992).
                  Assuming that the pattern representation fits into a single
                  computer word, this algorithm has optimal O(n
                  log\ensuremath{\sigma}m / m) average running time, as well as
                  optimal O(n) worst case running time, where n, m and
                  \ensuremath{\sigma} are the sizes of the text, the pattern,
                  and the alphabet, respectively. We also study several
                  implementation details. The experimental results show that our
                  algorithm is the fastest in most of the cases where it can be
                  applied, displacing even the long-standing BNDM (Navarro \&
                  Raffinot, 2000) family of algorithms. Finally, we show how to
                  adapt our techniques for the Shift-Add algorithm (Baeza-Yates
                  \& Gonnet, 1992), obtaining optimal time for searching under
                  Hamming distance.},

                  matching, based on an extension of the optimal (on average)
                  single-pattern approximate string matching algorithm of Chang
                  and Marr. Our algorithm inherits the optimality and is also
                  competitive in practice. We present a second algorithm that is
                  linear time and handles higher difference ratios. We show
                  experimentally that our algorithms are the fastest for
                  intermediate difference ratios, an area where the only
                  existing algorithms permitted simultaneous search for just a
                  few patterns. Our algorithm is also resistant to the number of
                  patterns, being effective for hundreds of patterns. Hence we
                  fill an important gap in approximate string matching
                  techniques, since no effective algorithms existed to search
                  for many patterns with an intermediate difference ratio.",

  abstract =     {Minimal perfect hash functions are used for memory efficient
                  storage and fast retrieval of items from static sets. We
                  present an infinite family of efficient and practical
                  algorithms for generating order preserving minimal perfect
                  hash functions. We show that almost all members of the family
                  construct space and time optimal order preserving minimal
                  perfect hash functions, and we identify the one with minimum
                  constants. Members of the family generate a hash function in
                  two steps. First a special kind of function into an r-graph is
                  computed probabilistically. Then this function is refined
                  deterministically to a minimal perfect has function. We give
                  strong theoretical evidence that the first step uses linear
                  random time. The second step runs in linear deterministic
                  time. The family not only has theoretical importance, but also
                  offers the fastest known methods for generating perfect hash
                  functions.},

  abstract =     {Increasing the accuracy of the nucleotide sequence alignment
                  is an essential issue in genomics research. Although classic
                  dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Smith Waterman and
                  Needleman Wunsch) guarantee to produce the optimal result,
                  their time complexity hinders the application of large scale
                  sequence alignment. Many optimization efforts that aim to
                  accelerate the alignment process generally come from three
                  perspectives: redesigning data structures (e.g., diagonal or
                  striped Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
                  implementations), increasing the number of parallelisms in
                  SIMD operations (e.g., difference recurrence relation), or
                  reducing searching space (e.g., banded dynamic programming).
                  However, no methods combine all these three aspects to build
                  an ultra-fast algorithm. We have developed a Banded Striped
                  Aligner(library) named BSAlign that delivers accurate
                  alignment results at an ultra fast speed by knitting a series
                  of novel methods together to take advantage of all of the
                  aforementioned three perspectives with highlights such as
                  active F loop in striped vectorization and striped move in
                  banded dynamic programming. We applied our new acceleration
                  design on both regular and edit distance pairwise alignment.
                  BSAlign achieved 2 fold speed up than other SIMD based
                  implementations for regular pairwise alignment, and 1.5 to 4
                  fold speedup in edit distance based implementations for long
                  reads. BSAlign is implemented in C programing language and is

                  optimal alignment and sacrifice alignment accuracy. Results:
                  We present POASTA, a new optimal algorithm for partial order
                  alignment that exploits long stretches of matching sequence
                  between the graph and a query. We benchmarked POASTA against
                  the state-of-the-art on several diverse bacterial gene
                  datasets and demonstrated an average speed-up of 4.1x and up
                  to 9.8x, using less memory. POASTA{\textquoteright}s memory
                  scaling characteristics enabled the construction of much
                  larger POA graphs than previously possible, as demonstrated by
                  megabase-length alignments of 342 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
                  sequences. Availability and implementation: POASTA is

  abstract =     {Motivation: Sampling k-mers is a ubiquitous task in sequence
                  analysis algorithms. Sampling schemes such as the often-used
                  random minimizer scheme are particularly appealing as they
                  guarantee that at least one k-mer is selected out of every w
                  consecutive k-mers. Sampling fewer k-mers often leads to an
                  increase in efficiency of downstream methods. Thus, developing
                  schemes that have low density, i.e., have a small proportion
                  of sampled k-mers, is an active area of research. After over a
                  decade of consistent efforts in both decreasing the density of
                  practical schemes and increasing the lower bound on the best
                  possible density, there is still a large gap between the two.
                  Results: We prove a near-tight lower bound on the density of
                  forward sampling schemes, a class of schemes that generalizes
                  minimizer schemes. For small w and k, we find optimal schemes
                  and observe that our bound is tight when k = 1 (mod w). For
                  large w and k, the bound can be approximated by
                  1/(w+k){\textperiodcentered}\lceil{}(w+k)/w\rceil{}.
                  Importantly, our lower bound implies that existing schemes are
                  much closer to achieving optimal density than previously
                  known. For example, with the default minimap2 HiFi settings
                  w=19 and k=19, we show that the best known scheme for these
                  parameters, the double decycling-set-based minimizer of Pellow
                  et al., is at most 3\% denser than optimal, compared to the
                  previous gap of at most 50\%. Furthermore, when k = 1 (mod w)
                  and \ensuremath{\sigma} {\textrightarrow}$\infty$, we show
                  that mod-minimizers introduced by Groot Koerkamp and Pibiri
                  achieve optimal density matching our lower bound.Competing

                  selected k-mers) of 2/(w + 1). In practice, lower density
                  leads to faster methods and smaller indexes, and it turns out
                  that the random minimizer is not the best one can do. Indeed,
                  some schemes are known to approach optimal density 1/w when k
                  {\textrightarrow}$\infty$, like the recently introduced
                  mod-minimizer (Groot Koerkamp and Pibiri, WABI 2024). In this
                  work, we study methods that achieve low density when k <=w. In
                  this small-k regime, a practical method with provably better
                  density than the random minimizer is the miniception (Zheng et
                  al., Bioinformatics 2021). This method can be elegantly
                  described as sampling the smallest closed sycnmer (Edgar,
                  PeerJ 2021) in the window according to some random order. We
                  show that extending the miniception to prefer sampling open
                  syncmers yields much better density. This new method - the
                  open-closed minimizer - offers improved density for small k
                  <=w while being as fast to compute as the random minimizer.
                  Compared to methods based on decycling sets, that achieve very
                  low density in the small-k regime, our method has comparable
                  density while being computationally simpler and intuitive.
                  Furthermore, we extend the mod-minimizer to improve density of
                  any scheme that works well for small k to also work well when
                  k \&gt; w is large. We hence obtain the open-closed
                  mod-minimizer, a practical method that improves over the
                  mod-minimizer for all k.Competing Interest StatementThe

  abstract =     {The rapid advancements in DNA sequencing technology have led
                  to an unprecedented increase in the generation of genomic
                  datasets, with modern sequencers now capable of producing up
                  to ten terabases per run. However, the effective indexing and
                  analysis of this vast amount of data pose significant
                  challenges to the scientific community. K-mer indexing has
                  proven crucial in managing extensive datasets across a wide
                  range of applications, including alignment, compression,
                  dataset comparison, error correction, assembly, and
                  quantification. As a result, developing efficient and scalable
                  k-mer indexing methods has become an increasingly important
                  area of research. Despite the progress made, current
                  state-of-the-art indexing structures are predominantly static,
                  necessitating resource-intensive index reconstruction when
                  integrating new data. Recently, the need for dynamic indexing
                  structures has been recognized. However, many proposed
                  solutions are only pseudo-dynamic, requiring substantial
                  updates to justify the costs of adding new datasets. In
                  practice, applications often rely on standard hash tables to
                  associate data with their k-mers, leading to high k-mer
                  encoding rates exceeding 64 bits per k-mer. In this work, we
                  introduce Brisk, a drop-in replacement for most k-mer
                  dictionary applications. This novel hashmap-like data
                  structure provides exceptional throughput while significantly
                  reducing memory usage compared to existing dynamic associative
                  indexes, particularly for large k-mer sizes. Brisk achieves
                  this by leveraging hierarchical minimizer indexing and memory
                  efficient super-k-mer representation. We also introduce novel
                  techniques for efficiently probing k-mers within a set of
                  super-k-mers and managing duplicated minimizers. We believe
                  that the methodologies developed in this work represent a
                  significant advancement in the creation of efficient and
                  scalable k-mer dictionaries, greatly facilitating their
                  routine use in genomic data analysis.Competing Interest

                  successful hashing algorithm in the literature. Recent
                  advances based on the idea of densification (Shrivastava \&
                  Li, 2014a;c) have shown that it is possible to compute k
                  minwise hashes, of a vector with d nonzeros, in mere (d + k)
                  computations, a significant improvement over the classical
                  O(dk). These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement
                  in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms
                  based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately, the variance of the
                  current densification techniques is unnecessarily high, which
                  leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla
                  minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this
                  paper, we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on
                  carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the
                  proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and without losing the
                  runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than
                  existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a
                  significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same
                  variance and collision probability as minwise hashing.
                  Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional

                  produce a sketch of size $k$, OPH requires just one hash
                  function whereas the classical minwise hashing requires $k$
                  hash functions. However, OPH does not have the desirable
                  locality sensitive hashing (LSH) property that is important
                  for indexing. [Srivastava and Li 2014, ICML] proposed the
                  novel idea of densification to produce LSH sketches from OPH
                  sketches, and gave the first densification routine. In this
                  paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a
                  densification routine to result in LSH sketches when applied
                  to OPH sketches. Furthermore, we give a novel densification
                  routine that for every input, takes O($k \log k$) time in
                  expectation and achieves better variance than the previous
                  best bound obtained by [Srivastava 2017]. The running time of
                  the densification routine given in [Srivastava 2017] for worst
                  case inputs is O($k^2$) in expectation.}

  abstract =     {The query complexity of \em locality sensitive hashing (LSH)
                  based similarity search is dominated by the number of hash
                  evaluations, and this number grows with the data
                  size&nbsp;\citeProc:Indyk_STOC98. In industrial applications
                  such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and
                  binary (e.g., text n-grams), \em minwise hashing is widely
                  adopted, which requires applying a large number of
                  permutations on the data. This is costly in computation and
                  energy-consumption. In this paper, we propose a hashing
                  technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations
                  needed for similarity search, using one single permutation.
                  The heart of the proposed hash function is a “rotation” scheme
                  which densifies the sparse sketches of \em one permutation
                  hashing&nbsp;\citeProc:Li_Owen_Zhang_NIPS12 in an unbiased
                  fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the
                  obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This
                  idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of
                  independent interest for densifying other types of sparse
                  sketches. Using our proposed hashing method, the query time of
                  a (K,L)-parameterized LSH is reduced from the typical O(dKL)
                  complexity to merely O(KL+dL), where d is the number of
                  nonzeros of the data vector, K is the number of hashes in each
                  hash table, and L is the number of hash tables. Our
                  experimental evaluation on real data confirms that the
                  proposed scheme significantly reduces the query processing
                  time over minwise hashing without loss in retrieval
                  accuracies.}

  abstract =     {Let A be a set of size m. Obtaining the first k ≤ m elements
                  of A in ascending order can be done in optimal O(m+k log k)
                  time. We present an algorithm (online on k) which
                  incrementally gives the next smallest element of the set, so
                  that the first k elements are obtained in optimal time for any
                  k. We also give a practical version of the algorithm, with the
                  same complexity on average, which performs better in practice
                  than the best existing online algorithm. As a direct
                  application, we use our technique to implement Kruskal's
                  Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, where our solution is
                  competitive with the best current implementations. We finally
                  show that our technique can be applied to several other
                  problems, such as obtaining an interval of the sorted sequence
                  and implementing heaps.},

  abstract =     {The cache oblivious model of computation is a two-level memory
                  model with the assumption that the parameters of the model are
                  unknown to the algorithms. A consequence of this assumption is
                  that an algorithm efficient in the cache oblivious model is
                  automatically efficient in a multi-level memory model. Arge et
                  al. recently presented the first optimal cache oblivious
                  priority queue, and demonstrated the importance of this result
                  by providingthe first cache oblivious algorithms for graph
                  problems. Their structure uses cache oblivious sorting and
                  selection as subroutines. In this paper, we devise an
                  alternative optimal cache oblivious priority queue based only
                  on binary merging. We also show that our structure can be made
                  adaptive to different usage profiles.},

                  thoroughly researched and carefully presented. All the machine
                  models central to the modern theory of computation are covered
                  in depth; many for the first time in textbook form. Readers

                  material presented." --Andrew C. Yao, Professor of Computer
                  Science, Princeton University "Models of Computation" is an
                  excellent new book that thoroughly covers the theory of
                  computation including significant recent material and presents
                  it all with insightful new approaches. This long-awaited book
                  will serve as a milestone for the theory community." --Akira
                  Maruoka, Professor of Information Sciences, Tohoku University
                  "This is computer science." --Elliot Winard, Student, Brown
                  University In Models of Computation: Exploring the Power of
                  Computing, John Savage re-examines theoretical computer
                  science, offering a fresh approach that gives priority to
                  resource tradeoffs and complexity classifications over the
                  structure of machines and their relationships to languages.
                  This viewpoint reflects a pedagogy motivated by the growing
                  importance of computational models that are more realistic
                  than the abstract ones studied in the 1950s, '60s and early
                  '70s. Assuming onlysome background in computer organization,
                  Models of Computation uses circuits to simulate machines with
                  memory, thereby making possible an early discussion of
                  P-complete and NP-complete problems. Circuits are also used to
                  demonstrate that tradeoffs between parameters of computation,
                  such as space and time, regulate all computations by machines
                  with memory. Full coverage of formal languages and automata is
                  included along with a substantive treatment of computability.
                  Topics such as space-time tradeoffs, memory hierarchies,
                  parallel computation, and circuit complexity, are integrated
                  throughout the text with an emphasis on finite problems and
                  concrete computational models FEATURES: Includes introductory
                  material for a first course on theoretical computer science.
                  Builds on computer organization to provide an early
                  introduction to P-complete and NP-complete problems. Includes
                  a concise, modern presentation of regular, context-free and
                  phrase-structure grammars, parsing, finite automata, pushdown
                  automata, and computability. Includes an extensive, modern
                  coverage of complexity classes. Provides an introduction to
                  the advanced topics of space-time tradeoffs, memory
                  hierarchies, parallel computation, the VLSI model, and circuit
                  complexity, with parallelism integrated throughout. Contains
                  over 200 figures and over 400 exercises along with an
                  extensive bibliography. ** Instructor's materials are

The proof involves the analysis of a heuristic algorithm that attempts to find a k-orientation of the random graph.The k-orientation threshold has several applications including offline balanced allocation with a limit of k on maximum bin-size, perfect hashing with a limit of k on maximum chain-length, and concurrent access to parallel memories through redundancy,},

abstract = {We investigate a linear time greedy algorithm for the following load balancing problem: Assign m balls to n bins such that the maximum occupancy is minimized. Each ball can be placed into one of two randomly choosen bins. This problem is closely related to the problem of orienting the edges of an undirected graph to obtain a directed graph with minimum in-degree. Using differential equation methods, we derive thresholds for the solution quality achieved by our algorithm. Since these thresholds coincide with lower bounds for the achievable solution quality, this proves the optimality of our algorithm (as n → ∞, in a probabilistic sense) and establishes the thresholds for k-orientability of random graphs. This proves an assertion of Karp and Saks.},
