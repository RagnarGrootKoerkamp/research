  abstract      = {We present an algorithm for the optimal alignment of sequences to genome graphs. It works by phrasing the edit distance minimization task as finding a shortest path on an implicit alignment graph. To find a shortest path, we instantiate the A* paradigm with a novel domain-specific heuristic function that accounts for the upcoming subsequence in the query to be aligned, resulting in a provably optimal alignment algorithm called AStarix.Experimental evaluation of AStarix shows that it is 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art optimal algorithms on the task of aligning Illumina reads to reference genome graphs. Implementations and evaluations are available at https://github.com/eth-sri/astarix.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract      = {We present a novel A* seed heuristic enabling fast and optimal sequence-to-graph alignment, guaranteed to minimize the edit distance of the alignment assuming non-negative edit costs. We phrase optimal alignment as a shortest path problem and solve it by instantiating the A* algorithm with our novel seed heuristic. The key idea of the seed heuristic is to extract seeds from the read, locate them in the reference, mark preceding reference positions by crumbs, and use the crumbs to direct the A\textasteriskcentered search. We prove admissibility of the seed heuristic, thus guaranteeing alignment optimality. Our implementation extends the free and open source AStarix aligner and demonstrates that the seed heuristic outperforms all state-of-the-art optimal aligners including Graphaligner, Vargas, PaSGAL, and the prefix heuristic previously employed by AStarix. Specifically, we achieve a consistent speedup of \&gt;60{\texttimes} on both short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads (up to 25kbp), on both the E. coli linear reference genome (lMbp) and the MHC variant graph (5Mbp). Our speedup is enabled by the seed heuristic consistently skipping \&gt;99.99\% of the table cells that optimal aligners based on dynamic programming compute.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract      = "{Pairwise alignment of sequences is a fundamental method in modern molecular biology, implemented within multiple bioinformatics tools and libraries. Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20–300\texttimes{} faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10–100\texttimes{} faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.}",

The operations we admit are deleting, inserting and replacing one symbol at a time, with possibly different costs for each of these operations. The problem of finding the longest common subsequence of two strings is a special case of the problem of computing edit distances. We describe an algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings of length n and m, n \eqslantgtr{} m, which requires O(n \cdot{} max(1, mlog n)) steps whenever the costs of edit operations are integral multiples of a single positive real number and the alphabet for the strings is finite. These conditions are necessary for the algorithm to achieve the time bound.}

  abstract      = {Finding the lowest-cost path through a graph is central to many problems including route planning for a mobile robot If arc costs change during the traverse then the remainder of the path may need to be replanned. This is the case for a sensor-equipped mobile robot with imperfect information about its environment. As the robot acquires additional information via its sensors it can revise its plan to reduce the total cost of the traverse. If the prior information is grossly incomplete the robot may discover useful information in every piece of sensor data. During replanning, the robot must either wait for the new path to be computed or move in the wrong direction therefore rapid replanning is essential The D* algorithm (Dynamic A*) plans optimal traverses ID real-time by incrementally repairing paths to the robots state as new information is discovered. This paper describes an extension to D\textasteriskcentered that focusses the repairs to significantly reduce the total time required for the initial path calculation and subsequent replanning operations. This extension completes the development of the D\textasteriskcentered algorithm as a full generalizatin of A\textasteriskcentered for dynamic environments where arc costs can change during the traverse of the solution path.},

  abstract      = {Agents often have to solve series of similar search problems. Adaptive A* is a recent incremental heuristic search algorithm that solves series of similar search problems faster than A* because it updates the h-values using information from previous searches. It basically transforms consistent h-values into more informed consistent h-values. This allows it to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase over time since consistent h-values remain consistent after action cost increases. However, it is not guaranteed to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can decrease over time because consistent h-values do not necessarily remain consistent after action cost decreases. Thus, the h-values need to get corrected after action cost decreases. In this paper, we show how to do that, resulting in Generalized Adaptive A\textasteriskcentered (GAA\textasteriskcentered) that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time. Our experiments demonstrate that Generalized Adaptive A\textasteriskcentered outperforms breadth-first search, A\textasteriskcentered and D\textasteriskcentered Lite for moving-target search, where D\textasteriskcentered Lite is an alternative state-of-the-art incremental heuristic search algorithm that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time.},

  abstract      = {Incremental heuristic search methods use heuristics to focus their search and reuse information from previous searches to find solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. In this paper, we apply Lifelong Planning A* to robot navigation in unknown terrain, including goal-directed navigation in unknown terrain and mapping of unknown terrain. The resulting D* Lite algorithm is easy to understand and analyze. It implements the same behavior as Stentz' Focussed Dynamic A\textasteriskcentered but is algorithmically different. We prove properties about D\textasteriskcentered Lite and demonstrate experimentally the advantages of combining incremental and heuristic search for the applications studied. We believe that these results provide a strong foundation for further research on fast replanning methods in artificial intelligence and robotics.},

Assuming that the pattern representation fits into a single computer word, this algorithm has optimal O(n log\ensuremath{\sigma}m / m) average running time, as well as optimal O(n) worst case running time, where n, m and \ensuremath{\sigma} are the sizes of the text, the pattern, and the alphabet, respectively. We also study several implementation details. The experimental results show that our algorithm is the fastest in most of the cases where it can be applied, displacing even the long-standing BNDM (Navarro \& Raffinot, 2000) family of algorithms. Finally, we show how to adapt our techniques for the Shift-Add algorithm (Baeza-Yates \& Gonnet, 1992), obtaining optimal time for searching under Hamming distance.},

Our algorithm inherits the optimality and is also competitive in practice. We present a second algorithm that is linear time and handles higher difference ratios. We show experimentally that our algorithms are the fastest for intermediate difference ratios, an area where the only existing algorithms permitted simultaneous search for just a few patterns. Our algorithm is also resistant to the number of patterns, being effective for hundreds of patterns. Hence we fill an important gap in approximate string matching techniques, since no effective algorithms existed to search for many patterns with an intermediate difference ratio.",

    abstract = {Minimal perfect hash functions are used for memory efficient storage and fast retrieval of items from static sets. We present an infinite family of efficient and practical algorithms for generating order preserving minimal perfect hash functions. We show that almost all members of the family construct space and time optimal order preserving minimal perfect hash functions, and we identify the one with minimum constants. Members of the family generate a hash function in two steps. First a special kind of function into an r-graph is computed probabilistically. Then this function is refined deterministically to a minimal perfect has function. We give strong theoretical evidence that the first step uses linear random time. The second step runs in linear deterministic time. The family not only has theoretical importance, but also offers the fastest known methods for generating perfect hash functions.},

  abstract      = {Increasing the accuracy of the nucleotide sequence alignment is an essential issue in genomics research. Although classic dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch) guarantee to produce the optimal result, their time complexity hinders the application of large scale sequence alignment. Many optimization efforts that aim to accelerate the alignment process generally come from three perspectives: redesigning data structures (e.g., diagonal or striped Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) implementations), increasing the number of parallelisms in SIMD operations (e.g., difference recurrence relation), or reducing searching space (e.g., banded dynamic programming). However, no methods combine all these three aspects to build an ultra-fast algorithm. We have developed a Banded Striped Aligner(library) named BSAlign that delivers accurate alignment results at an ultra fast speed by knitting a series of novel methods together to take advantage of all of the aforementioned three perspectives with highlights such as active F loop in striped vectorization and striped move in banded dynamic programming. We applied our new acceleration design on both regular and edit distance pairwise alignment. BSAlign achieved 2 fold speed up than other SIMD based implementations for regular pairwise alignment, and 1.5 to 4 fold speedup in edit distance based implementations for long reads. BSAlign is implemented in C programing language and is available at https://github.com/ruanjue/bsalign.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract      = {Motivation: Partial order alignment is a widely used method for computing multiple sequence alignments, with applications in genome assembly and pangenomics, among many others. Current algorithms to compute the optimal, gap-affine partial order alignment do not scale well to larger graphs and sequences. While heuristic approaches exist, they do not guarantee optimal alignment and sacrifice alignment accuracy. Results: We present POASTA, a new optimal algorithm for partial order alignment that exploits long stretches of matching sequence between the graph and a query. We benchmarked POASTA against the state-of-the-art on several diverse bacterial gene datasets and demonstrated an average speed-up of 4.1x and up to 9.8x, using less memory. POASTA{\textquoteright}s memory scaling characteristics enabled the construction of much larger POA graphs than previously possible, as demonstrated by megabase-length alignments of 342 Mycobacterium tuberculosis sequences. Availability and implementation: POASTA is available on Github at https://github.com/broadinstitute/poasta.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract      = {Motivation: Sampling k-mers is a ubiquitous task in sequence analysis algorithms. Sampling schemes such as the often-used random minimizer scheme are particularly appealing as they guarantee that at least one k-mer is selected out of every w consecutive k-mers. Sampling fewer k-mers often leads to an increase in efficiency of downstream methods. Thus, developing schemes that have low density, i.e., have a small proportion of sampled k-mers, is an active area of research. After over a decade of consistent efforts in both decreasing the density of practical schemes and increasing the lower bound on the best possible density, there is still a large gap between the two. Results: We prove a near-tight lower bound on the density of forward sampling schemes, a class of schemes that generalizes minimizer schemes. For small w and k, we find optimal schemes and observe that our bound is tight when k = 1 (mod w). For large w and k, the bound can be approximated by 1/(w+k){\textperiodcentered}\lceil{}(w+k)/w\rceil{}. Importantly, our lower bound implies that existing schemes are much closer to achieving optimal density than previously known. For example, with the default minimap2 HiFi settings w=19 and k=19, we show that the best known scheme for these parameters, the double decycling-set-based minimizer of Pellow et al., is at most 3\% denser than optimal, compared to the previous gap of at most 50\%. Furthermore, when k = 1 (mod w) and \ensuremath{\sigma} {\textrightarrow}$\infty$, we show that mod-minimizers introduced by Groot Koerkamp and Pibiri achieve optimal density matching our lower bound.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Sampling algorithms that deterministically select a subset of k-mers are an important building block in bioinformatics applications. For example, they are used to index large textual collections, like DNA, and to compare sequences quickly. In such applications, a sampling algorithm is required to select one k-mer out of every window of w consecutive k-mers. The folklore and most used scheme is the random minimizer that selects the smallest k-mer in the window according to some random order. This scheme is remarkably simple and versatile, and has a density (expected fraction of selected k-mers) of 2/(w + 1). In practice, lower density leads to faster methods and smaller indexes, and it turns out that the random minimizer is not the best one can do. Indeed, some schemes are known to approach optimal density 1/w when k {\textrightarrow}$\infty$, like the recently introduced mod-minimizer (Groot Koerkamp and Pibiri, WABI 2024). In this work, we study methods that achieve low density when k <=w. In this small-k regime, a practical method with provably better density than the random minimizer is the miniception (Zheng et al., Bioinformatics 2021). This method can be elegantly described as sampling the smallest closed sycnmer (Edgar, PeerJ 2021) in the window according to some random order. We show that extending the miniception to prefer sampling open syncmers yields much better density. This new method - the open-closed minimizer - offers improved density for small k <=w while being as fast to compute as the random minimizer. Compared to methods based on decycling sets, that achieve very low density in the small-k regime, our method has comparable density while being computationally simpler and intuitive. Furthermore, we extend the mod-minimizer to improve density of any scheme that works well for small k to also work well when k \&gt; w is large. We hence obtain the open-closed mod-minimizer, a practical method that improves over the mod-minimizer for all k.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The rapid advancements in DNA sequencing technology have led to an unprecedented increase in the generation of genomic datasets, with modern sequencers now capable of producing up to ten terabases per run. However, the effective indexing and analysis of this vast amount of data pose significant challenges to the scientific community. K-mer indexing has proven crucial in managing extensive datasets across a wide range of applications, including alignment, compression, dataset comparison, error correction, assembly, and quantification. As a result, developing efficient and scalable k-mer indexing methods has become an increasingly important area of research. Despite the progress made, current state-of-the-art indexing structures are predominantly static, necessitating resource-intensive index reconstruction when integrating new data. Recently, the need for dynamic indexing structures has been recognized. However, many proposed solutions are only pseudo-dynamic, requiring substantial updates to justify the costs of adding new datasets. In practice, applications often rely on standard hash tables to associate data with their k-mers, leading to high k-mer encoding rates exceeding 64 bits per k-mer. In this work, we introduce Brisk, a drop-in replacement for most k-mer dictionary applications. This novel hashmap-like data structure provides exceptional throughput while significantly reducing memory usage compared to existing dynamic associative indexes, particularly for large k-mer sizes. Brisk achieves this by leveraging hierarchical minimizer indexing and memory efficient super-k-mer representation. We also introduce novel techniques for efficiently probing k-mers within a set of super-k-mers and managing duplicated minimizers. We believe that the methodologies developed in this work represent a significant advancement in the creation of efficient and scalable k-mer dictionaries, greatly facilitating their routine use in genomic data analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Minwise hashing is a fundamental and one of the most successful hashing algorithm in the literature. Recent advances based on the idea of densification (Shrivastava \& Li, 2014a;c) have shown that it is possible to compute k minwise hashes, of a vector with d nonzeros, in mere (d + k) computations, a significant improvement over the classical O(dk). These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately, the variance of the current densification techniques is unnecessarily high, which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this paper, we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and without losing the runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the significant advantages, our method will replace minwise hashing implementations in practice.},

We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and without losing the runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the significant advantages, our method will replace minwise hashing implementations in practice.}

  abstract = 	 {One Permutation Hashing (OPH) is a significantly more efficient alternative to the popular minwise hashing. To produce a sketch of size $k$, OPH requires just one hash function whereas the classical minwise hashing requires $k$ hash functions. However, OPH does not have the desirable locality sensitive hashing (LSH) property that is important for indexing. [Srivastava and Li 2014, ICML]  proposed the novel idea of densification to produce LSH sketches from OPH sketches, and gave the first densification routine. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a densification routine to result in LSH sketches when applied to OPH sketches. Furthermore, we give a novel densification routine that for every input, takes O($k \log k$) time in expectation and achieves better variance than the previous best bound obtained by [Srivastava 2017]. The running time of the densification routine given in [Srivastava 2017] for worst case inputs is O($k^2$) in expectation.}

In industrial applications such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and binary (e.g., text n-grams),  \em minwise hashing is widely adopted, which requires applying a large number  of permutations on the data. This is  costly in computation and energy-consumption.    In this paper, we propose a  hashing technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations needed for similarity search, using  one single permutation.  The heart of the proposed hash function is a  “rotation” scheme which densifies the sparse sketches of \em one permutation hashing&nbsp;\citeProc:Li_Owen_Zhang_NIPS12 in an unbiased fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of independent  interest  for densifying  other types of sparse sketches.     Using our proposed hashing method, the  query time of a (K,L)-parameterized LSH is reduced from  the typical O(dKL) complexity to merely O(KL+dL), where d is the  number of nonzeros of the data vector, K is the number of hashes in each hash table, and L is the number of hash tables.  Our experimental evaluation on real data confirms that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the query processing time over minwise hashing without loss in retrieval accuracies.}
