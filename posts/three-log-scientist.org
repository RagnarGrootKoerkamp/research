A rating system for theoretical computer scientists.
The more logarithms there are (i.e. the more "$\log$" before your variables),
the higher your reputation will be.
No-log theoretical computer scientists are virtually non-existent, as virtually
all non-trivial algorithms require use of logarithms.
Most are one-log scientists.
In the old times (well, I'm young, so these look like old times to me at least), one would occasionally find a piece of code done by a three-log scientist and shiver with awe.

Some people even claimed they'd seen four-log algorithms, or even $\log^*$. Sounded as real as UFOs to me.

*Just to be clear: Being called a ThreeLogScientist is usually /not/ a compliment.*
