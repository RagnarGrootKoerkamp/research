Once upon a time, Chromium had a bug where using =$mod+f= in i3 to
fullscreen the Chromium window changed the window to occupy the entire
screen, but didn't actually make Chromium enter full screen mode.
According to some, those[fn:1] were[fn:2] the[fn:3] good[fn:4]
days[fn:5][fn:6]. Watching 4 YouTube streams in parallel was still
possibly, back in those days:

#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:fullscreen.png]]

Without patches, the best we can do nowadays[fn:7] is the following

#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:windowed.png]]

Luckily, there is a [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/4255][pull
request]] to fix this for Sway! Use the
=sway-inhibit-fullscreen-git=[[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sway-inhibit-fullscreen-git/][AUR
package]] to install this branch.

Using this branch, you can add the following to your Sway config:

#+begin_example
bindsym $mod+f fullscreen
bindsym $mod+Shift+f inhibit_fullscreen toggle
#+end_example

The first of these commands, =fullscreen= is still the usual command you
will be used to: this toggles the size of a window to occupy the full
screen. Usually, this will also change chromium to its full screen mode.

When executing the second command while the chromium window is focused,
the chromium full screen state will be completely detached from the the
Sway full screen state. Thus, after toggling the =inhibit_fullscreen=
state, we can now independently use =$mod+f= to change the size of the
chromium window, and =F11= to change whether or not e.g.Â the tab bar is
visible. Simply do =$mod+Shift+f= while the window is focused to merge
the states again.

This gives two new possibilities:

- Make chromium fill the entire screen, but still show the tab bar.
- Make chromium fill only part of the screen, but don't show the tab
  bar. Especially useful for watching videos on only part of the screen.

[fn:7] Actually, in Sway 1.6 you can still get this behavior by making
       the parent container fullscreen, since that used to also set all
       child containers to full screen mode. However, this is
       [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/6152][fixed]] for the next
       release.
