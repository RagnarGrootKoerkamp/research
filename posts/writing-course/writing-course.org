Some notes from the writing course I'm taking.

* Lecture 1, 14 November
** Resources
- Searching phrases/alternatives in quotes in Google Scholar can tell which one
  is more frequently used.
- [[https://ozdic.com]] contains /collocations/: words frequently occuring together
  with the searched word.
- [[https://www.english-corpora.org/iweb]] another resource for looking
  collocations; more scientifically rigorous than Ozdic.
- [[https://books.google.com/ngrams]] counts ngram usage over time, and compares
  usage over time. Also allows e.g. =* difference*= to find the most common word
  before =difference=.
- [[https://scholar.google.com]]: Allows search quoted terms for frequency count in papers.

- [[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/][Cambridge]] and [[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/][Oxford]] dictionaries are good enough. They not only give
  definitions but also typical usage and e.g. common proposition.


** Reader friendlyness
- Keep subject and verb close to each other.
- Avoid unneeded words; keep things brief.
- Avoid multiple reasons (=in order to=, =owing to=, =due to=). Even avoid =In
  order to= completely; just =To= suffices.
- Avoid complicated words; no unneeded repetitions.

** Typical problems
- Object far from verb
- Front-loading
- Dangling modifiers
- Lack of parallelism
- Redundancy: A, which B, that C, so that D.
- Stacking
- Turgid sentences: overstuffed.

* Lecture 2, 21 November
** Paragraph level expectations
[[file:topic_sentence.png]]
- *Topic sentence*: 1st sentence of paragraph creates expectations about the *content* of the rest of
  the paragraph.
  - don't have to, but recommended
  - makes implicit expectations explicit
  - should not be too specific. Following sentence make things more precise.
  - simple, wide, not specific, not too vague
- *Preview sentence* / Framing sentence
  - establish expectations about the *structure* of the paragraph
  - Can give the number of items following: /We distinguish two cases./
- Topic and preview sentence may be merged.
- Possible paragraph structure
  1. Topic sentence
  2. Preview sentence
  3. Aspect 1
  4. Detail 1
  5. Aspect 2
  6. Detail 2
  7. Conclusion (optional)
- Other paragaph structures:
  - general -> specific
  - specific -> general
  - situaion - problem - solution - evaluation
  - compare - contrast
  - advantages - disadvantages
  - cause - effect
  - chronological
** Flow
Beginning of sentence follows up on very end of previous sentence.

Default flow: old to new.
- Begin with old information (possibly repetition)
- Move on to new information.
- Repetition because of this is OK, and can help reader understanding.

Sometimes this is not possible, or we have a focus shift, use a *linker* /
*transition marker*, e.g. /however/.

Starting with new information can be used for special effect, but should be used sparingly.

Flow strategies:
1. Exact/partial repetition: variation of a word; synonyms; pronouns (/it/,
   /they/, /these/, ...).
2. This/These + summary noun, e.g. /these ideas/.
3. /Fronting/: place a phrase/clause at the start of the sentence, e.g. /In England, it rains a lot./
4. Passive voice to move new information to the end.

But: sometimes beginning of sentence refers to beginning of previous sentence.
- e.g. multiple comments about the same thing.

Conclusion: multiple possible information progressions.

#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:information-flow.png]]

- argumentation: linear progression
- description: constant progression

- For technical terms, exact repetition (or possibly partial repetition) is
  preferred over synonyms that may end up being confusing.


** Assignment for next week

2 paragraphs of texts for a paper/thesis/...., by monday.

* Lecture 3, 28 November
- Repeating things is a good thing. Helps reader.
- Don't be afraid to repeat e.g. /procedure/ a few times. Synonyms are not

** Bad organization
- chronological
- Bundling all proofs/results in one section and discussion elsewhere
- rambling introduction on tangentially related research
- Unfounded claims of relevance
- Disproportionate attention to minor details
- Not sufficient context
- No motivation
- No /signposting/

  [[file:structure.png]]

** Figures
1. Introduce fig: Figure X shows ...
2. Describe: As can be seen, ...
3. Highlight key points: The most common ...
4. Commenting on the results:

Commenting from strong to weak:
- shows
- suggests
- indicates
- implies (in an informal sense, rather than mathematical sense)

Modal verbs and adverbs:
- =can= stronger than =could=
- =may= stronger than =might=
- =*would* seems=
- =probably=

*Don't be too weak!* You do want to explain the properties of the data.

- =Figure 5 shows X=: indicative, what is shown
- =Figure 5 shows *that* X=: informative, conclusion drawn from what is shown.

- =is shown in table 1=: 1.8M
- =Table 1 shows=: 3.3M
- =(see table 1)=: 4M
- =As shown in Table 1=: 1.6M

** References to figures
- We report .. in table 1
- Table 2 shows ...
- In Table 3a we report ...
- Table 3a is presented to highlight ...
- Figure 1 shows an example of ...
- Figure 2 shows the average number of ...
- This is graphically evident from Figure 2, looking at ...
- Figure 3 shows an example.
- At the other end of .. visible in Figure 4,
- In Figure 4 we show
- As already noted in Figure 4
- as shown in step 3 of the pseudocode

Conclusions:
- All indicative, none informative
- No imperative
- No parens
- All present tense
- Verbs: =shows=
- Examples: =in ... we report=

** Indicative vs Informative (ex. 7)
- *indicative*: Table 1 shows X
- *informative*: Table 1 shows that X
|             | indicative | informative |
| show        | y          | y           |
| illustrate  | y          | y           |
| reveal      | n          | y           |
| indicate    | n          | y           |
| demonstrate | y          | y           |
| suggest     | n          | y           |
| give        | y          | y           |
| present     | y          | n           |
| display     | y          | y           |
| summarise   | y          | n           |
| provide     | y          | n           |


* Lecture 4, December 5
** Introduction
Functions in introduction
- Problem
- Solution
- Research context
- Results
- Benefits
- (Limitations)
Moves:
1. Establish research territory
   - Show that the area is important/problematic/relevant in some way (almost always)
   - Review related work.

   'claiming centrality'; emphasize importance

   - present perfect: ~has been studied~, started in the past and still now
   - present simple: ~remains~
   both talk about the importance of the work /in the present/

2. Establish a niche
   - something is missing
   - something needs to be added
   - something isn't good enough
   - 'mini-critique'
   - indicate contrast

   Examples:
   - /Little work has been done/
   - /Few studies have .../
   - /less attention/
   - /studies have emphasized A *as opposed* to B/
3. Occupy the niche
   - outline the structure of text
   - outline purpose
   - listing research questions
   - principal findings
   - indicating value

Introduction phrases: https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/introducing-work/

- Move 3 takes most of the space. Move 2 takes very little space.
** Conclusion
- looking back
- looking forward
Example structure, specific to general:
- restatement of aims
- summary of methods/results
- comparison to other research
- limitations
- implications/impact
- recommendations/future research


*** Tense
- =we solved=, =we presented= (past simple), is in the past but somewhat detached from the now.
- =we have solved= (present perfect) makes it more relevant for now. (Either works.)
- Don't use use present tense (=we conduct=).
- =More research will be needed ...=

* Lecture 5, December 12
** Abstracts
Possible structures:
- AMRC
  1. (Background)
  2. activity/purpose
  3. methods
  4. results
  5. conclusion
- B/SPSE
  1. Background/situation
  2. problem
  3. solution
  4. evaluation

** Titles
- Most often a /long noun phrase/.
- Sometimes two parts.
- Rarely a question.
** Punctuation
*** Comma
*Do use comma:*
- Before /and/, /or/, /but/, /yet/, /for/, and /so/ when connecting two main
  *complete* clauses.
  - *Not*: A does not rely on X but on Y.
- Around *non-defining* relative clauses (i.e. when it can be removed without
  losing meaning):
  - /The teacher, who is called Mark, is cool./
  - /My girlfriend, who lives in spain, .../ (My only one, who happens to live there.)
- Oxford comma
- When subordinate clause with (/although/, /because/, /when/, /if/, /unless/,
  /until/, /since/, /before/) precedes main clause:
  - /When you do X, you may do Y./
- After introductory phrase:
  - /Additionally, .../
  - /Before submission, .../
- Around inserted phrase/interruption:
  - /A, or sometimes B, is special./

*Do not use comma:*
- Between *incomplete* clauses:
  - /I wrote a book and read it./
- Between *defining* relative clause:
  - /Clauses that are not connected .../
  - /My girlfriend who lives in Spain, .../ (The one in spain, not the other one.)
- When the main clause precedes the subordinate clause:
  - /We eat until we are all finished./
- Not before /that .../ if the subclause is the object/subject.
  - /We believe that .../

*** Dashes
- hyphen: to join inseperable words.
- n-dash: for ranged and periods of time. /calais-dover/, /1999-2019/.
- m-dash: to separate and insert whole phrases. No spaces around it in British English.
