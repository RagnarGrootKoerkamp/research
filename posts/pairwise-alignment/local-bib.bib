abstract = {The edit distance between two character strings can be defined as the minimum cost of a sequence of editing operations which transforms one string into the other. The operations we admit are deleting, inserting and replacing one symbol at a time, with possibly different costs for each of these operations. The problem of finding the longest common subsequence of two strings is a special case of the problem of computing edit distances. We describe an algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings of length n and m, n ⪖ m, which requires O(n · max(1, mlog n)) steps whenever the costs of edit operations are integral multiples of a single positive real number and the alphabet for the strings is finite. These conditions are necessary for the algorithm to achieve the time bound.}

    abstract = "{Pairwise alignment of sequences is a fundamental method in modern molecular biology, implemented within multiple bioinformatics tools and libraries. Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20–300× faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10–100× faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.}",
