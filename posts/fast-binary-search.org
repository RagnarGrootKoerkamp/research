** TODO Memory efficiency

Suppose our task is to find an integer $q$ in a sorted list $A$ of length $n$.
One option is to use binary search, but using a B-tree or the Eytzinger layout
turns out faster when $n$ is large. See the excellent paper
[cite/t:@khuong-array-layouts] for background and detailed comparisons.

Here, I'd like to compare the memory efficiency of the B-tree and Eytzinger
layout.
That is: which method puts the least pressure on the memory system, and can thus
get higher potential throughput
