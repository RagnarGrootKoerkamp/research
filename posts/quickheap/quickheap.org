There was a hackernews [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44812695][post]] recently on a new single-source shortest path
algorithm [cite:@sssp], that takes $O(m (\log n)^{2/3})$ time, which is less than
$O(m + n \log n)$ (the complexity of Dijkstra with Fibonacci heaps with $O(1)$ inserts) when
$m \leq n (\log n) ^{1/3}$, or equivalently, when the average degree satisfies
$d=m/n=O((\log n) ^{1/3})$.
Anyway -- this got me thinking about heaps. Specifically, about how fast we can
make them.

The bottom line is that there is the /quickheap/ data structure
[cite:@quickheap] and its improved version [cite:@stronger-quickheaps], and my
implementation of this ([[https://github.com/ragnargrootkoerkamp/quickheap][github:ragnargrootkoerkamp/quickheap]]) is 2 to 3$\times$
faster than the other [[https://crates.io/keywords/heap][heaps]]/[[https://crates.io/keywords/priority-queue][priority queues]] from crates.io that I tested.

As for the title: there are many papers on I/O efficient and cache-oblivious
heaps and priority queues [cite:@priority-queue-survey], but I am not able to
find a modern implementation of any one of them -- somehow they don't seem used at
all in practice. On the other hand, there is the /radix heap/ [cite:@radix-heap]
that is faster at times, but it can only be used in cases where the extracted
keys increase with time.

Jump straight to [[#implementation][Implementation]] or [[#results][Results]].

* Background

** Priority queue

As a quick recap, for the purposes of this post, a /priority queue/ ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue][wikipedia]])
is a data structure
that supports the following two operations:
- Push (insert) :: Add a value $x$ to the data structure.
- Pop (extract min) :: Remove and return the /smallest/ value $x$ in the data structure.

Other possible operations include /find min/ (peek), /delete/, and /decrement
key/, but we will not consider these.

Note: most literature seems to present the min-queue as above, but Wikipedia and
implementations often use a max-queue, where a pop returns the maximum
element instead.

** Binary heap

The binary heap ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap][wikipedia]]) works by using the /Eytzinger layout/, also known as simply the /heap layout/.
This represents $n$ values as a binary tree that is stored layer by layer.
If we put the root at index 1, the children of node $i$ are at $2i$ and $2i+1$.
The /heap invariant/, which makes the tree into a /heap/ ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)][wikipedia]]),
is that each value is at most the value of its two children, which
implies that the root is the smallest value.

*Push* is implemented by first appending the new value to the array, which adds
it as the next node in the bottom layer of the tree (or possibly creating a new
layer). Then, we ensure the invariant is preserved by swapping the new element
with its parent as long as its larger.

*Pop* is implemented by first extracting the root, and replacing it with the
last element of the queue. Then, we again ensure the invariant is preserved by
sifting down: we swap the root with the smaller of its two children as long as needed.

We can see that in the worst case, both these operations take $\lg n =
\log_2(n)$ steps.

** D-ary heaps

D-ary heaps ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-ary_heap][wikipedia]]) generalize binary heaps so that each node has up to $d$ children.
Their main benefit is that they have better cache locality, and require fewer
levels of traversing the tree. The drawback is that sifting down requires
finding the minimum of $d$ elements rather than just 2, but this is anyway fast
using some SIMD instructions.


** Other heaps
Other heaps are the /radix heap/ ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_heap][wikipedia]], [[https://ssp.impulsetrain.com/radix-heap.html][nice blog explanation]]) [cite:@radix-heap], which implements a /monotone/
priority queue where the priority of the popped elements may only increase. This
is for example the case when running Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with
non-negative edge weights.

The /sequence heap/ [cite:@sequence-heap] and funnel heap [cite:@funnel-heap]
are two similar I/O efficient / cache-oblivious data structures. (But, according
to [cite/t:@priority-queue-survey], they serve slightly different purposes.)
They build on the idea of /binary mergers/: given two input buffers containing
sorted data, they merge those into a sorted output buffer as needed. These
"gadgets" are used to build $k$-way mergers, and a chain of these is made for
exponentially increasing $k$.

The /cascade heap/ [cite:@cascade-heap] has $O(1)$ inserts, and $O(\log^* n +
\log k)$ pop for the $k$'th popped element. Thus, this avoids the overhead of
doing too much up-front work.
The /logarithmic funnel/ [cite:@log-funnel-heap] takes a similar approach of
building high dimensional trees.

A more broad survey is given by [cite/t:@priority-queue-survey], which
surprisingly does not mention the quickheap described below.


* Literature on Quickheaps

Sorting algorithms go back a long way. One way to sort a list is to put all
elements in a heap and then extract them one by one, called /heapsort/ [cite:@heapsort].

Another method is quicksort, which works as follows: first, choose a random
element of the array as /pivot/. Then compare all elements to this pivot, and
move the smaller ones to the front of the array, and the larger ones to the back
of the array. Then recurse on the two halves.
This runs in $O(n\log n)$ time, since the number of levels in the recursion is
expected to be $O(\log n)$.

** Optimal incremental sorting

A related problem is to only sort the smallest $k\leq n$ elements, which can be
done in $O(n + k \log k)$.
Heapsort does this, but incurs an up-front cost of $O(n \log
n)$.
[cite/t:@optimal-incremental-sorting] give an
incremental $O(n+k\log k)$ method that returns the smallest elements one by one in
sorted order.
Their method, /IncrementalQuickSelect/ (IQS) builds on the ideas of quicksort:
1. Choose a random pivot and partition the array.
2. Push the position of the pivot to a stack.
3. Recurse on the left part with smaller values until only a single element is
   left. This is the minimum.
4. Pop that element, go up the stack, and recurse on the elements between this
   pivot and the next as needed.
5. Repeat until the array is empty.

#+name: iqs
#+caption: Example from [cite/t:@optimal-incremental-sorting] of the IQS method: a random (here: first) element is chosen as pivot to partition the array. This is repeated until only a single element is left, and the positions of all pivots are stored on a stack.
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:./incrementalquickselect.png]]

On random input, IQS takes average time $O(n + k \log k)$.


** Quickheap

The conclusions of the 2006 paper above already mention that this same idea can
be used to build a heap. This is presented in detail in [cite/t:@quickheap].

Compared to the incremental sorting method above, the one additional operation
it needs to support is pushing new elements.

#+name: quickheap
#+caption: Example from [cite/t:@quickheap] of inserting an element (35) into the quickheap.
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:./quickheap.png]]

Like with binary heaps, we first push the new element to the back of the array,
and then sift it (down, in this case) to its right location: as long as the new
element is less than the preceding pivot, that pivot (eg 51 above) is shifted one position to
the right to make space for the new element, and the new element is inserted on
its left.

Since the tree is expected to have $O(\log n)$ many levels on random input, this
takes $O(\log n)$ steps, as for binary heaps.
Additionally, it is shown that the I/O cost of push and pop is $O((1/B) \log
(m/M))$, where $B$ is the block size and $M$ is the total available memory,
which is close to optimal.
Thus, quickheaps make efficient use of the memory bandwidth.

#+name: quickheap-plot
#+caption: On a sequence of m times (ins, (del, ins)^2) followed by m times (del, (ins, del)^2), quickheap (QH) is faster than the binary heap (BH) and pairing heap (PH), but slightly slower than the sequence heap (SH), which are optimized for cases where /all/ elements are extracted. Note that the y-axis reports the time divided by m lg(m).
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:./quickheap-plot.png]]

Quickheaps are also shown to have much lower I/O cost than radix heaps.

A drawback of quickheaps is that the analysis only works for randomized operations.

** Randomized quickheaps
When the keys being inserted into quickheap are mostly decreasing, this causes
the number of layers/pivot to grow over time. This results in worst-case linear
time inserts, since elements have to sift down linearly many layers.

Randomized quickheaps (RQH) [cite:@stronger-quickheaps] solve this: every time an
element is inserted and moves down one layer, the entire subtree starting in
that layer is /flattened/ with probability $1/s$ when it has $s$ elements. That
is, all pivots in the subtree are dropped, and the next pop operation will pick
a new random pivot. This way, each subtree is re-randomized roughly once each
time it doubles in size.

#+name: random-quickheap-plot
#+caption: On a sequence of m times (ins, (del, ins)^2) followed by m times (del, (ins, del)^2), the random quickheap (RQH) is faster than both the binary heap (BH) and quickheap (QH) for sufficiently large inputs.
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:./random-quickheap-plot.png]]

The paper by [cite/t:@worst-case-optimal-incremental-sorting] takes a more
practical approach to optimal worst-case behaviour.
One could use the median-of-medians algorithm to select a
pivot in the 30%-70% interval in linear time, but this is slow in practice.
Instead, they first try a random pivot, and only fall back to median-of-medians
in case this random pivot is not in the 30%-70% interval.

* Bucket-based implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: implementation
:END:
** Data structure
The original quickheap papers store everything in a flat array, without
additional memory. In my implementation ([[https://github.com/ragnargrootkoerkamp/quickheap][github]]), I instead use a single bucket (vector)
per layer. This simplifies the partition steps, since they do not have to be
in-place, but comes at the cost of somewhat higher memory usage.
Additionally, I store a flat list of the pivot values for all layers, rather
than their positions.
Lastly, I stop the recursion when layers have size at most 16. Then, this list
is simply scanned to extract the smallest element.


#+name: quickheap
#+caption: A schematic overview of the quickheap: elements are stored in /layers/. Deeper layers have smaller values, with each layer being at most its pivit. The bottom layer has at most 16 (here: 4) elements. Popping is done by scanning the bottom layer, and pushing is done by comparing the new value to all pilots and appending to the correct layer. To split a layer, a random pivot is selected as the median of 3 and smaller elements are pushed to the next layer, while larger elements stay. Values equal to the pivot are pushed down if they are on its left.
#+attr_html: :class inset large
[[file:./quickheap.svg]]

#+caption: My version of the =QuickHeap= data structure.
#+begin_src rust
type T = u32;
struct QuickHeap {
    /// The number of layers.
    layer: usize,
    /// A decreasing array of the pivots for all layers.
    /// pivots[0] = T::MAX
    pivots: Vec<T>,
    /// The values in each layer.
    /// pivots[i] >= elements of buckets[i] >= pivots[i+1]
    buckets: Vec<Vec<T>>,
}
#+end_src

The active/last layer is stored separately, so that we can reuse buffers instead
of deallocating them.

** Push

Push is implemented by simply comparing the new element against /all/ the
pivots, and then inserting it into the right layer.

#+attr_shortcode: "Code for pushing a new value."
#+begin_detail
#+caption: We count the number of pivots larger than the new element.
#+begin_src rust
fn push(&mut self, x: T) {
    let mut target_layer = 0;
    for &p in &self.pivots[..=self.layer] {
        if p > x {
            target_layer += 1;
        }
    }
    self.buckets[target_layer - 1].push(x);
}
#+end_src

To enable maximum efficiency of SIMD comparisons, in practice we do this:
#+caption: By always comparing to a multiple of 8 number of elements, each block of 8 is compiled to some SIMD instructions.
#+begin_src diff
 fn push(&mut self, x: T) {
     let mut target_layer = 0;
-    for &p in &self.pivots[..=self.layer] {
+    for &p in &self.pivots[..(self.layer+1).next_multiple_of(8)] {
         if p > x {
             target_layer += 1;
         }
     }
     self.buckets[target_layer - 1].push(x);
 }
#+end_src
#+end_detail

This has complexity $O((\log n)/L)$ when using $L$ SIMD lanes, which in practice
is fast, especially when $L=8$ for =u32= values.
One option for some speedup could be to turn this into a 2-level B-tree, with a
root node that divides the levels into $L+1$ chunks.

** Pop
Pop is more tricky. We split the current (bottom) layer as long as it has more
than 16 elements. Then, we find the position of the minimum and remove it by
swapping it with the last element in the layer. Lastly, we decrease the active
layer if we exhausted it.

#+attr_shortcode: "Code for popping the smallest value."
#+begin_detail
#+caption: Popping works by first splitting the layer as long as it has more than 16 elements, and then scanning the remaining elements for the minimum.
#+begin_src rust
fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
    // Only the top layer can be empty.
    if self.buckets[self.layer].len() == 0 {
        return None;
    }
    // Split the current layer as long as it is too large.
    while self.buckets[self.layer].len() > 16 {
        self.partition();
    }
    // Find and extract the minimum.
    let layer = &mut self.buckets[self.layer];
    let min_pos = layer.iter().position_min().unwrap();
    let min = layer.swap_remove(min_pos);

    // Update the active layer.
    if layer.is_empty() && self.layer > 0 {
        self.pivots[self.layer] = 0;
        self.layer -= 1;
    }
    Some(min)
}
#+end_src
#+end_detail

** Partition
This leaves only the partitioning of the layers. Of note are the fact that I use
the median of 3 candidate pivots, and that the partitioning is based on AVX2
SIMD instructions inspired by Daniel Lemire's [[https://lemire.me/blog/2017/04/10/removing-duplicates-from-lists-quickly/][blog]] (see [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/quickheap/blob/master/src/simd.rs][github]] for the detailed code).

#+attr_shortcode: "Code for partitioning the bottom layer."

#+caption: Partitioning the bottom layer works by reserving two sufficiently large arrays, and then using SIMD instructions to append values =< pivot= to one and values ~>= pivot~ to the other.

fn partition(&mut self) {
    // Reserve space for an additional 8 layers when needed.
    if self.layer + 2 == self.pivots.len() {
        self.pivots.extend(repeat_n(0, 8));
        self.buckets.extend(repeat_n(vec![], 8));
    }
    // Alias the current layer (to be split) and the next layer.
    let [cur_layer, next_layer] = &mut self.buckets[self.layer..=self.layer + 1] else {
        unreachable!()
    };
    let n = cur_layer.len();

    // Select 3 random pivots, and compute their median.
    let mut pivots: [T; 3] = from_fn(|_| cur_layer[rand::random_range(0..n)]);
    pivots.sort();
    // Pivots are exclusive.
    let pivot = pivots[1] + 1;
    self.pivots[self.layer + 1] = pivot;

    // Reserve space in the next layer,
    // and make sure the current layer can hold a spare SIMD register.
    next_layer.resize(n + 8, 0);
    cur_layer.resize(n + 8, 0);

    // Partition a list into two using SIMD.
    let mut cur_len = 0;
    let mut next_len = 0;
    for i in (0..n).step_by(8) {
        let vals = *cur_layer[i..i + 8].as_array().unwrap();
        simd::partition(
            u32x8::from_array(vals),
            n - i, // Only use the at most n-i remaining elements.
            pivot,
            cur_layer,

        );
    }
    cur_layer.resize(cur_len, 0);
    next_layer.resize(next_len, 0);

    // If we extracted all elements to the next layer
    // because the pivot was the largest one,
    // undo and try again.

        std::mem::swap(cur_layer, next_layer);

    }

** Libraries
I benchmarked against a few heap and priority queue crates.
I did not find any implementation of (randomized) quickheap either online or in
the papers[fn::There is [[https://github.com/emmt/QuickHeaps.jl]], but it seems to
just be a "quick" binary heap.], but there are some d-ary heaps:
- [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BinaryHeap.html][=std::collections::BinaryHeap=]]: a plain binary max-heap. Used with
  [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/struct.Reverse.html][=Reverse<u32>=]] to make it a min-heap.
- [[https://docs.rs/orx-priority-queue/latest/orx_priority_queue/struct.DaryHeap.html][=orx_priority_queue::DaryHeap<(), u32, D>=]]: a d-ary heap, tested for D in 1,2,4,8.
- [[https://docs.rs/dary_heap][=dary_heap::DaryHeap<u32, D>=]]: another d-ary heap, tested for D in 1,2,4,8.

#+attr_shortcode: "Excluded implementations."
#+begin_detail
- [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html][=std::collections::BTreeSet=]]: does not natively support duplicate elements,
  and also ~2x slower than other methods.
- [[https://docs.rs/indexset/latest/indexset/struct.BTreeSet.html][=indexset::BTreeSet=]]: idem.
- [[https://docs.rs/fibonacci_heap/latest/fibonacci_heap/][=fibonacci_heap::FibonacciHeap=]]: a Fibonacci heap, but 10x slower than
  everything else.
- [[https://docs.rs/pheap/latest/pheap/][=pheap::PairingHeap=]]: a pairing heap, but slower than other heaps.
#+end_detail

We /do/ compare against a radix heap, which is specialized for cases where the popped keys increase with time.
- [[https://docs.rs/radix-heap/][=radix_heap::RadixHeapMap=]]

** Datasets
I test on a few types of data. First off, we test keys with types:
- =u32=
- =u64=

For each type, we construct a number of test cases. Each
has the structure
$$
F_k(n) := (\mathsf{push}\circ(\mathsf{pop}\circ\mathsf{push})^k)^n \circ(\mathsf{pop}\circ(\mathsf{push}\circ\mathsf{pop})^k)^n.
$$
1. *Heapsort*: $F_0(n)$: $n$ random pushes, followed by $n$ pops. I.e. a heapsort.
2. *Random*: $F_4(n)$ with random pushes.
   This simulates a heap that slowly grows and then slowly shrinks.
3. *Linear*: $F_4(n)$, where the $i$th push pushes value $i$.
4. *Increasing*: $F_4(n)$, but pushes increase by a random amount:
   - for =u32=: the last popped value plus a random value up to 1000.
   - for =u64=: the last popped value plus a random value up to $2^{32}$.

** Results

#+caption: (Click to enlarge.) Log-log plots of the average time per push-pop pair. Top row: =u32= values, bottom row: =u64= values. Left to right corresponds to the four datasets listed above: heapsort, random, linear, and increasing.
#+caption: The shown time is the total time divided by $2k+1$, and thus is the average time for an element to be pushed and popped again. Experiments are stopped once they take >100 ns.
#+caption: Memory usage is 4 or 8 times more than $n$, and ranges from 8 KiB to 128 MiB for =u32= and double that for =u64=.
#+attr_html: :class inset large
[[file:quickheap-results.svg][file:./quickheap-results.svg]]

Some observations:
- The *binary heap* (blue) and d-ary heaps (orange, green) have similar
  performance for =u32= and =u64=.
- The *4-ary heap* (green) in =orx_priority_queue= is consistently slightly faster than
  the default binary heap.
- The *8-ary heap* in =dary_heap= is usually much slower, but slightly faster for
  large $n$.
  - (Other d-ary heap variants are only rarely better than both of these two.)
- The *quickheap* (red) is the fastest for both heapsort and the interleaved
  variant with random pushes.
  - For heapsort, it's up to 2x faster for =u32= for large $n$, because most
    time is spent partitioning lists, and this is 2x faster for the smaller data type.
  - For random interleaved pushes, this difference is nearly gone. Most likely
    this is because roughly 75% of pushed elements will directly be popped again.
    In fact, the *performance is nearly independent of $n$* here!
  - Exact linear pushes are probably the worst for quickheap, as these always
    get pushed to the top layer and then need to
    sift down through the maximum possible number of layers.
- The *radix* heap (purple) has constant performance for heapsort, since its
  $O(n\log C)$ term only depends on the number of bits in the input values,
  which is 32 or 64. This is also the worst possible input for radix sort.
  - Random pushes interleaved with pops are not supported, since the minimum
    value in the heap may only increase.
  - Radix sort is the fastest for linear input, likely because of its cache locality.
  - For =u32= input that increases by 0 to 1000 on each push, radix sort gets
    *faster* as $n$ increases, probably because there are very many duplicate elements.
  - For =u64= input that increases by 0 to $2^{32}$ on each push, radix sort is
    not as good, because now $\log C=\log2^{32}$ is quite large (compared to
    $\log 1000$ before). As in the heapsort case, the performance is constant
    though, because $\log C$ is constant.

* Conclusion
Overall, the radix heap is probably a good choice in cases where it can be used,
specifically for small integer input.
Otherwise, the quickheap is significantly faster than binary/d-ary heaps,
especially as $n$ grows.
This is primarily because of its better cache efficiency and
corresponding I/O complexity:
Binary/d-ary heaps must access $O(\log n)$ memory locations and have a cache
miss (of cost $\sqrt {2^i}$, see [[https://www.ilikebigbits.com/2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1.html][this blog on The Myth of RAM]]) at each layer $i$, whereas
the quickheap pushes to one of $O(\log n)$ known (cached) locations, pops
from a single location, and has memory-efficient partitioning as well.

** Still TODO
- I have not yet implemented the ideas from the randomized quickheap [cite/t:@stronger-quickheaps] to
  prevent the worst-case quadratic growth.
- I'd like to run experiments on some more realistic datasets. I could compare
  Dijkstra with the radix heap and quickheap, but then I need some interesting
  graphs to test on.
- Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm][wikipedia]]) is a case where the radix
  heap will not work, and might be a good case to show the improvement of the
  quickheap over d-ary heaps. But again, this needs some graphs to test on.
- Are there non-graph applications of heaps? Things like an 'event queue' come
  to mind: when processing a sorted list of intervals, we push the end of the
  interval after processing the start. But again a radix heap (or even a bucket
  heap) is probably better here, unless the timestamps are very high precision.
