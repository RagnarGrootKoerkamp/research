These are chronological (and thus, only lightly organized) notes on my attempt to
understand how DDR4 and DDR5 RAM memory work.

See [[#results][the final results]] for the conclusion on how virtual addresses map to physical addresses.

* Questions

Specific questions to be answered:
- How is data distributed among the chips?
- How does /dual channel/ DDR work?
  - And does the CPU become a bottleneck here?
- How does RAM /work/?
- Are there internal cache sizes?
- What is /burst/?
  - Can we disable it?
  - Can we read only a single word?
- And /prefetching/? (8n, 16n)
  - Why? (reduce downtime / communication overhead)
  - Stored how?
- Why does DDR5 have 2x32 lanes instead of DDR4's 64bit lanes?
- How large are /rows/ and /columns/?
- What about LPDDR (= lower power DDR)
- What's a /transfer/ anyway
- /banks/? /bank groups/?
  - transferring to different bank groups is faster?
- DDR5: 2/4/8 bank groups
- How does virtual memory map to physical memory?

** Notes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_dynamic_random-access_memory#PREFETCH:
#+begin_quote
[DDR3] Row accesses might take 50 ns, depending on the speed of the DRAM, whereas column accesses off an open row are less than 10 ns.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
DDR4 did not double the internal prefetch width again, but uses the same 8n prefetch as DDR3.[29] Thus, it will be necessary to interleave reads from several banks to keep the data bus busy.
#+end_quote

- dual channel has 2 chips doing the _exact_ same work, interleaving things at
  the level of words: 64 bits to one and 64 bits to the other.
  - Does this mean an effective RAM cache size of 1024 bits, given burst mode???

https://www.synopsys.com/articles/ddr4-bank-groups.html
- prefetch matches cacheline size
- DDR4: bank groups, so multiple reads can happen 'in parallel'
  - a prefetch happens within a bank group, but takes time
  - 16n prefetch would be larger than a cacheline, not useful
  - instead: 2 (or more) bank ground that work independently in parallel
  - alternating groups is faster than consecutive reads in a group
    - 4 cycles across groups; more within
  - 1600MHz gives up to 3200Mb/s when alternating, or 2133Mb/s within the same group
  - alternating between banks: can fully saturate the bandwidth with 4 internal
    cycles (8 transfers) between bursts
  - on the same group, only as low as ~half the throughput

jedec standard:

page 15: 2Gb x8 addressing:
- 4 bank groups (2bits)
- 4 banks inside a group (2bits)
- 17bit row ID => 128ki rows
- 10bit col ID => 1024 cols
- 1KB page size (#cols * 8 banks)
  
=> total page size for 8 chips: 8KB.


Possible experiment:
- read =a[i]=, where i iterates over the integers with only a fixed subset of
  bits set, like a mask of =111101001110000=. Trying all patterns, we can try to
  hit consecutive rows on the same bank.
- multithreaded setting; always have a certain bit of the index at 0, the rest 1
  - try to always hit the same bank
  - try to always hit the same rank

Side note:
- L1 prefetch needs fill buffers, but the L2 hardware prefetcher does not!

gemini: cache lines are alternated between dimms/channels.

[cite:@zenhammer]
#+begin_quote
For example, modern memory mappings, such as AMD-Zen [11], split a 4KB page
such that it gets distributed across 32 banks (with only two lines of a page
co-resident in the same bank).
Such mappings exploit the available bank-level parallelism for reads, even at
the expense of the row-buffer hit-rate.
#+end_quote
- interesting indeed: reading from different banks is faster than consecutive
  reads from a single row then
- more generally, I guess cachelines are round-robin between banks then

#+begin_quote
For a 64-bit DDR4 interface, this means the controller can support a single x64 channel, or dual x32 channels.
#+end_quote
ie, there are cases where the two dimms do exactly the same work but on half the
bits. Then additional bank (groups) are available for parallellism

with two memory controllers (same as channels or not?):
- memory can be interleaved at eg 1KB block size, or 
- each controller is half the address space

** Address mapping notation

This pages is really nice:
- https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/pg313-network-on-chip/Address-Mapping-Notation

Example: =16R-2B-2BG-10C=:
- ignore low 3 bits, because we get 64b = 8B = 2^3 B back.
- 10 bits for column. Ie a linear piece of memory fills a row.
  - Each column is 64b = 8B across all banks, 1024 columns per row = 8KiB
- 2 bits for the bank group, ie spread 4 rows over 4 distinct bank groups
- 2 bits for bank, ie then take a row in each bank of each group
- 15 bits for row, ie then use the other rows in each bank


Reading consecutively from the same row (in the same bank) is slow though. So
instead, we can alternate bank group after every 64B cache line (aka bank group optimization):
=16R-2B-1BG-7C-1BG-3C=: this moves 1 BG bit to the end, so we interleave reads
to two bank groups to be able to fully saturate the bandwidth. This has 95%
efficiency, compared to 54% of the simple row-bank-column approach.

#+begin_quote
If addressing is random and transaction size is equal to the DRAM basic access unit, then no address mapping has an advantage. The DRAM controller will reorder transactions to hide page access overhead as much as possible. Expected efficiency is around 40%.
#+end_quote

** Intel spec

Intel spec:
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/10th-gen-core-families-datasheet-vol-1-datasheet.pdf

#+begin_quote
Addresses are ping-ponged between the channels after each cache line (64-byte boundary). 
#+end_quote

5.1.5:
- just-in-time: most efficient request scheduled first, e.g., one that hits a
  different bank than the last instruction.
- command overlap: send stuff to other banks while one is doing slow activate/pre-charge/read/write
- out-of-order: batch requests to the same open page
  
** Rank interleaving
https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddr4-memory-organization-and-how-it-affects-memory-bandwidth/#:~:text=Multi%2Drank%20memory%20modules%20use,rank%20can%20start%20its%20transmission.

#+begin_quote
Multi-rank memory modules use a process called rank interleaving, where the ranks that are not accessed go through their refresh cycles in parallel
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
On the other hand, there is some I/O latency penalty with multi-rank memory modules, since memory controllers need additional clock cycles to move from one rank to another. 
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
one row can remain active per bank

** Nontemporal reads/writes
https://vgatherps.github.io/2018-09-02-nontemporal/

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9ccb88/optimizing_cache_usage_with_nontemporal_accesses/

#+begin_quote
because they are only beneficial if you can prove that the address being stored to is not in cache, and would not be present in cache at next use even if a normal store were used.

they break some of the usual ordering guarantees.

the performance is catastrophically bad (significantly worse than normal stores) when the address is present in cache.

* reMap: using Performance counters
https://github.com/helchr/reMap

[cite/t:@reversing-dram-addressing] uses performance counters to read directly
how many times each rank/bank group/bank is accessed.

It uses stuff from =/sys/bus/event_source/devices/uncore_imc/=

=type= is =14=.

here
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64923795/using-linux-perf-tool-to-measure-the-amount-of-times-the-cpu-has-to-acccess-the
I read that only Xeon/servers have these cas counters.

*Performance counter monitor*: https://github.com/intel/pcm
- =pcm-memory= with per-bank stats only works on Xeon unfortunately

* Sudoku
Really cool paper and software: [cite/title/b:@sudoku-dram-address-mapping] [cite:@sudoku-dram-address-mapping].
https://github.com/scale-snu/Sudoku

hugepages setup:
#+begin_src sh
cd /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB
cat nr_hugepages # likely prints 0
cat free_hugepages # likely prints 0
# just over half of the 64GB memory
echo 40 | sudo tee nr_hugepages
cat nr_hugepages # should print 40
cat free_hugepages # likely prints 40
#+end_src

speed:
#+begin_src c
#define SBDR_LOWER_BOUND_ 350
#+end_src
memory config:
#+begin_src c
{DDRType::DDR4, 64ULL * GB, 8, 2, 2, 17, 10, 8 * 1024, 8}
#+end_src

I also incremented =max_bits_= by 2 in the =Sudoku= constructor. Not exactly sure why it's needed.

We also pin the cpu frequency to 3.0GHz (slightly above the native 2.6GHz):
#+begin_src sh
sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor powersave -d 3.0GHz -u 3.0GHz
#+end_src

** Step 1: DRAM addressing functions
ie things that map to the same bank

command:
#+begin_src sh
sudo ./reverse_functions -o out -p 40 -t ddr4 -n 2 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l
#+end_src

functions:
#+begin_src 
0x4080
0x88000
0x110000
0x220000
0x440000
0x4b300
#+end_src

** Step 2: row/column bits
#+begin_src sh
sudo ./identify_bits -o out -p 40 -t ddr4 -n 2 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l\
    -f 0x4080,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000,0x440000,0x4b300
#+end_src

result with masking:
column bits: 0xdc0
row_bits,0xffff80000
column_bits,0xdc0

Note that some column bits are still missing, as ~0xdc0 = 1101 1100b~ only has 5
instead of 7 bits set. (We are looking for 7 bits, because each column has $2^{10}$
64-bit words and thus $2^7$ cache lines.)

** Step 3: validation
#+begin_src sh
sudo ./validate_mapping -o out -p 40 -t ddr4 -n 2 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l\
    -f 0x4080,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000,0x440000,0x4b300 \
    -R 0xffff80000 \
    -C 0xdc0
#+end_src
#+begin_src txt
[-] There are incomplete disjoint sets.
0x4cb300,
Insert bit 9 to column_bits
Insert bit 12 to column_bits
#+end_src
So real column should be 0x1FC0, exactly the same as in Table 2 in the paper for
another intel DDR4 machine. (That only has 7 bits, because the last 3 column bits
indicate 8 64bit words that always share a cacheline [I think].)

We get:
#+begin_src txt
Validated DRAM address mapping:
  functions:0x4080,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000,0x440000,0x4b300,
  row_bits:0xffff80000
  column_bits:0x1fc0
#+end_src

** Step 4: which function is what?
Lets first have a manual look at these functions:
#+begin_src 
000000000000000000000001111111000000 -- col
000000000000000000000100000010000000 -- dimm/rank?
000000000000000001001011001100000000 -- channel?
000000000000000010001000000000000000 -- bank/group?
000000000000000100010000000000000000 -- bank/group?
000000000000001000100000000000000000 -- bank/group?
000000000000010001000000000000000000 -- bank/group?
111111111111111110000000000000000000 -- row
#+end_src
They use 36 bits, corresponding to $2^{36} = 64$ GiB of data.

Also note that the low 6 bits are 0, because we have $2^6=64$ byte cache lines.

*Some [wrong] guesses.*
We already /know/ the row and column bits, but the rest is speculation for now.
Looking at the Sudoku paper, we need 4 functions for banks and bank groups, so I
would speculate that's the four very similar ones.
Then we need 2 to select the DIMM and rank within a channel (because each
channel could have 2 rank-2 memory sticks), so I'd guess the two similar
patterns that remain. Specifically, that would mean the highest bit determines
the DIMM, of which I only have 1 in each channel, and thus be unused.

That leaves one 'weird'/'chaotic' pattern for the channel, which also seems to
match the Sudoku table [cite:@sudoku-dram-address-mapping]:

#+attr_html: :class inset large
[[file:./sudoku-table.png]]

** Refreshes

Now lets have a look at the output of =decompose_functions=, which does
additional experiments to distinguish DIMMs/ranks/bank groups/bank.
#+begin_src sh
sudo ./decompose_functions -o out -p 40 -t ddr4 -n 2 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l\
    -f 0x4080,0x4b300,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000,0x440000 \
    -R 0xffff80000 \
    -C 0x1fc0
#+end_src

Specifically, it chooses two addresses that only differ by a given function and
then alternatingly reads them. DRAM needs regular 'refreshing', every 64ms or so, which for my
hardware takes =tRFC1 = 350ns=. This can be done one either one bank at a time,
or for all banks simultaneously.

If we now choose 2 addresses and read them alternatingly, we will see one of two
patterns. If they are in the same /refresh group/, we will see a single refresh
delay every refresh cycle. If they are in different refresh groups, we will see
two refresh patterns interleaved.

You might need to play a bit with the =REGULAR_REFRESH_INTERVAL_THRESHOLD= parameter.
We get:
#+begin_src txt
[+] Check refresh intervals of function 0x4080
Functions: 0x4080, tREFI: 1015, tREFI/2: 9
[+] Check refresh intervals of function 0x4b300
Functions: 0x4b300, tREFI: 1016, tREFI/2: 8
[+] Check refresh intervals of function 0x88000
Functions: 0x88000, tREFI: 1018, tREFI/2: 6
[+] Check refresh intervals of function 0x110000
Functions: 0x110000, tREFI: 0, tREFI/2: 1024          <------ channel selector?
[+] Check refresh intervals of function 0x220000
Functions: 0x220000, tREFI: 1019, tREFI/2: 5
[+] Check refresh intervals of function 0x440000
Functions: 0x440000, tREFI: 1020, tREFI/2: 4
#+end_src

These numbers mean the following: for 5 of the 6 functions, we consistently
observe a =tREFI= delay, which is the refresh interval. (I still have not found
a way to extract the actual value of number from my hardware.)
The =0x10000= function on the other hand consistently shows a smaller interval
between refreshes, meaning that this switches data to a different refresh group.

Thus, I speculate that =0x110000= determines the DIMM, and all banks on each
DIMM (across /both/ ranks) refresh at the same time.

See also /Auto-refresh/ (AR) on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_refreshjjjjjj][wikipedia]].

** Consecutive Accesses
Now we look at the time between consecutive accesses, =tRDRD= (time ReaD ReaD)
and specifically =tCCD_S= and =tCCD_L=, the time between consecutive reads in
different (S, short) and the same (L, long) bank groups, assuming row-buffer hits.
For this, the tool schedules 4 consecutive reads from each of two rows and lets
the memory controller execute them as fast as possible.

We get this:
#+begin_src txt
Functions: 0x4080, Avg RDRD latency: 347                   <---- bank group/channel
[+] Check consecutive memory accesses of function 0x4b300
Functions: 0x4b300, Avg RDRD latency: 346                  <---- bank group/channel
[+] Check consecutive memory accesses of function 0x88000
Functions: 0x88000, Avg RDRD latency: 345                  <---- bank group/channel
[+] Check consecutive memory accesses of function 0x110000
Functions: 0x110000, Avg RDRD latency: 400                 <---- rank (Before: DIMM?)
[+] Check consecutive memory accesses of function 0x220000
Functions: 0x220000, Avg RDRD latency: 396                 <---- bank
[+] Check consecutive memory accesses of function 0x440000
Functions: 0x440000, Avg RDRD latency: 397                 <---- bank
#+end_src

Latency here represents the number of clock cycles to read a total of 8 values.

Based on the paper, alternating between channels should be fastest, followed by
bank groups. Alternating between banks and Rank is slower.

My guesses are based on correlating these results with the plot from the Sudoku paper:

#+attr_html: :class inset small
[[file:./sudoku-latency.png]]

#+attr_html: :class small

* Sudoku, now with only 1 DIMM

** setup

1. Allocate 20 1GB hugepages
2. Add an entry to the table with 32 GB.
   #+begin_src c
    {DDRType::DDR4, 32ULL * GB, 8, 2, 2, 17, 10, 8 * 1024, 8},
   #+end_src
** 1. reverse functions
3. run the same command as before, but now for 1 DIMM and 20 pages:
   #+begin_src sh
   sudo ./reverse_functions -o out -p 17 -t ddr4 -n 1 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l
   #+end_src

Changes to make it work:
Change timing to
#+begin_src c
#define SBDR_LOWER_BOUND_ 330
#define SBDR_UPPER_BOUND_ 400
#+end_src
and use the median instead of average time.

This outputs:
#+begin_src txt
Found functions:
  0x2040
  0x44000
  0x88000
  0x110000
  0x220000
#+end_src

** 2. identify bits


#+begin_src sh
sudo ./identify_bits -o out -p 17 -t ddr4 -n 2 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l\
    -f 0x2040,0x44000,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000
#+end_src

with original =max_bits= or +1:
#+begin_src 
Found bits: 
  row_bits,0x3fffc0000
  column_bits,0x1fc0
#+end_src

The only issue here is that this has only 16 row bits. Likely it doesn't detect
the last one because I only have slightly over half of the memory used. Either
way we can assume that the real row bits should be =0x7fffc0000=

** 3. validate mapping
#+begin_src 
sudo ./validate_mapping -o out -p 17 -t ddr4 -n 1 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l\
    -f 0x2040,0x44000,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000 \
    -R 0x3fffc0000 \
    -C 0x1fc0
#+end_src

** 4. decompose functions
#+begin_src sh
sudo ./decompose_functions -o out -p 17 -t ddr4 -n 1 -s 32 -r 2 -w 8 -d -v -l\
    -f 0x2040,0x44000,0x88000,0x110000,0x220000 \
    -R 0x3fffc0000 \
    -C 0x1fc0
#+end_src
The situation is more clear now: the interleaved refresh intervals are across
the two ranks. And then the 2 fast RDRD latencies are across groups and the two
slow ones across banks.

Summary on how to interpret this:
- =col= indicates that the low 7 bits are used to indicate the column to read from.
- =row= indicates that the high 16 or 17 bits determine the row to read from.
- All other masks indicate that the xor of the indicated address-bits is taken,
  and the parity determines the channel/rank/group/bank. Each rank has 4 groups
  containing 4 banks each, so these get 2 bits assigned to them.

In general these look very similar. Differences:
- With 2 DIMMs, pairs of cachelines go next to each other in the same row. With
  1, they are scattered across groups.
- With 2 DIMMs, the lowest level scattering is changed to channels. The first
  group-scatter gets a somewhat random mask.

  
* =decode-dimms=

Here I'm logging the output of running some analysis tools.

=decode-dimms=, part of =i2c-tools=, on arch is a nice tool to read
information from memory module EEPROM.
But note that this is /static/ information, and /not/ the current mode.
For me it prints eg:

#+end_src

This confirms some information we already knew by now:
- 2 ranks per DIMM
- 10 column bits, 17 row bits, and 16 banks.
The question is how relevant the timing parameters are if these are not
necessarily the current values.

  
** Bank groups
reading from different bank groups takes the minimum of 4 cycles (in which 8
words are transmitted)

** Refresh
https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/1gdz1bv/are_trefi_and_trfc_the_only_temperature_sensitive/

64ms between refreshes, split in 8192 groups, so 64ms/8192=7.8us on average
between refresh calls

Each call is around 350ns=4.5% long, blocking the entire rank.

** Random access throughput
Limitations:
- opening a single row in a bank
  - tRCD = 13.750 ns to move row into amplifiers
  - tRAS = 32.000 ns to move it back
- between reads in a group: 4.9ns
- between reads across groups: 2.5ns
- but either way: at most 4 reads on the rank every 21ns => 5.25 ns/read limit
  per rank (or DIMM?)

* CPU benchmarks
Lastly, some benchmarks, run with both 1 and 2 DIMMs.

Nontemporal writes get to 44 GB/s, which is not too far of the max of
~2*25.6=51.2~ GB/s. This corresponds to 1.45 ns/cacheline, which is a bit faster
than the best of 1.72 ns/cacheline we observed above for streaming reads.

==                                                                      ==
== Many ARM devices use a part of the system memory as the framebuffer, ==
== typically mapped as uncached but with write-combining enabled.       ==
== Writes to such framebuffers are quite fast, but reads are much       ==
== slower and very sensitive to the alignment and the selection of      ==
== CPU instructions which are used for accessing memory.                ==
==                                                                      ==
== Many x86 systems allocate the framebuffer in the GPU memory,         ==
== accessible for the CPU via a relatively slow PCI-E bus. Moreover,    ==
== PCI-E is asymmetric and handles reads a lot worse than writes.       ==
==                                                                      ==
== If uncached framebuffer reads are reasonably fast (at least 100 MB/s ==
== or preferably >300 MB/s), then using the shadow framebuffer layer    ==
== is not necessary in Xorg DDX drivers, resulting in a nice overall    ==
== performance improvement. For example, the xf86-video-fbturbo DDX     ==
== uses this trick.                                                     ==

== Average time is measured for random memory accesses in the buffers   ==
== of different sizes. The larger is the buffer, the more significant   ==
== are relative contributions of TLB, L1/L2 cache misses and SDRAM      ==
== accesses. For extremely large buffer sizes we are expecting to see   ==
== page table walk with several requests to SDRAM for almost every      ==
== memory access (though 64MiB is not nearly large enough to experience ==
== this effect to its fullest).                                         ==
==                                                                      ==
== Note 1: All the numbers are representing extra time, which needs to  ==
==         be added to L1 cache latency. The cycle timings for L1 cache ==
==         latency can be usually found in the processor documentation. ==
== Note 2: Dual random read means that we are simultaneously performing ==
==         two independent memory accesses at a time. In the case if    ==
==         the memory subsystem can't handle multiple outstanding       ==
==         requests, dual random read has the same timings as two       ==
==         single reads performed one after another.                    ==

* Remaining questions
- Why do we not so interleaved refresh intervals between reads from different
  DIMMs?
  - Speculative answer: they auto-synchronize. As soon as 1 starts a refresh,
    the other becomes idle and will also refresh.
- Why is alternating reads between channels not faster than alternating between
  groups?
  - I guess because both are maximally fast?
- Why is alternating reads between ranks quite a bit slower?
  - No ideas here; the rank-to-rank switching time should be only a single cycle
    or so.
- How do things change on big servers (EPYC) with multiple memory controllers?
- Does sending read instructions consume a cycle? Can reading and controlling
  happen in parallel?
