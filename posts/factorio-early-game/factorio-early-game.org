This is the start of a series of posts on our (=philae=, =winston=) play
through Factorio with the Space Exploration mod.

After lots of struggling, we recently finished our first SE world after
624 in-game hours. Since this was also our first/second Factorio world,
the start was very inefficient and we learned a lot of things along the
way. In this new map, which we call /Endurance/ (after the
interplanetary spaceship in /Interstellar/), we will apply what we
learned, and share it with the world :)

Like the first map, /Endurance/ will be using a 100x100 city block based
approach, but more on that later. Unlike last time, we completely
disabled biters and pollution this time, for a few reasons. First, we
really want to focus on designing a nice, scalable, and clean factory.
We spent lots of time fighting biters previously. This always
interrupted our design and building process, sometimes even causing us
to lose all our inventory items. The fighting felt repetitive, and
neither of us enjoyed this, so not having them just makes the game more
fun. Lastly, disabling pollution and biter pathing will hopefully save
some compute resources and make the game run at 60UPS for a while
longer. While our last world has 624 in-game hours, the game was running
at ~25UPS instead of the usual 60UPS towards the end, so we likely
exceeded 1000 real-world hours.

* Looking back
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: looking-back
   :END:
The goal is for /Endurance/ to be an improved version of our previous
base:

*Overview*

#+caption: Early base. Click to enlarge.
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_overview.png][file:old_overview.jpg]]

On the left of the map is the old starter base, which contains small
production lines for vanilla science packs and robots, as well as the
main mall. The science pack production lines there were sufficient even
for end game, but the robot production was frequently struggling to keep
up with the rate of robot crashing in Nauvis orbit. The mall was far
away from most of the base and was entirely supported by robots, which
we plan to improve on in /Endurance/.

*City blocks*

#+caption: Detail 1
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_detail_1.png][file:old_detail_1.jpg]]

City blocks are 100x100, built upon Nilaus' classic design. Stations are
in the adjacent rail blocks, and we usually fit 4 double rows of
factories inside each block, often rounded up/down to produce a full
number of blue belts. After some time, the four roboports in the middle
of the cityblocks became rather annoying to work around. Halfway through
the game, we changed to having 8 roboports along the /Sacred Path/ and
one in the centre of each block, forming a 3x3 grid. (Side note: the
Sacred Path isn't actually that /Sacred/ in SE, because jet packs are
the usual way of travelling.)

We initially used a decentralised storage system, with a few yellow
chests in every city block. This soon became a problem, as robots often
flew across the map to store or retrieve a simple item in an
unpredictable way. This will be fixed by making one central storage,
close to the mall and the center of the map.

*Trains*

#+caption: Detail 2
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_detail_2.png][file:old_detail_2.jpg]]

Trains ran along a 4-lane RHD rail system (2 lanes in each direction)
that had their own dedicated city blocks. We started with 2-4 trains (2
locomotives and 4 cargo/fluid wagons) but switched to 2-2-2 trains (2
wagons, 2 locomotives, 2 wagons) halfway through the game. The
incompatibility of the two designs complicated the factory building
process. We plan to stick to 2-2-2 trains from the beginning this time.

We made a single big depot, but this created lots of contention on a
small part of the rail network, so the plan is to make more smaller
dedicated depots next time.

*Symmetric City Blocks*

A typical late-game city block is the one producing red chips:

#+caption: Red chip cityblock
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_cityblock.png][file:old_cityblock.jpg]]

This one in particular is much cleaner than the early game blocks. As
you can see, this one has perfect symmetry. Using the late game SE wide
area beacons, this factory is rather compact and uses belt weaving to
keep the space needed for belts to a minimum. This is important because
the beacons only cover a limited area and the modules to fill them are
expensive.

The stations also show our (un)loading /API/: the 2-2-2 trains provide
12 rows in the middle, where each of the left 3 stations can unload to 4
of those 12 lanes. The unloading has integrated lane balancers. These
balancers aren't perfect 4-to-4, but they are all-to-all and sufficient
for out needs: smoothing out small irregularities that occasionally
happen because a non-full train comes in. One slight annoyance is that
the train actually has odd total length, so there are unused /buffer/
rows just above the top locomotive, and just below the bottom wagon.

*Rail layout*

The rail layout we ended with looks as follows:

#+caption: Rail layout
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_rail.png][file:old_rail.jpg]]

This layout supports 1 to 4 stations per side, or even more when growing
into the neighbouring blocks. Each station has exits to each of the 4
central lanes, and trains can U-turn in each block. The central 4 lanes
/exactly/ fit a 6-wagon train in the middle, so there are 4 rail signals
to mark these as such.

One addition on top are the extra fifth/sixth lanes connecting stations
in adjacent blocks. This allows trains to drive to the next block
without blocking the other traffic. In practice we didn't use this much,
but since it's using otherwise dead space, /why not/.

*SE Sciences*

Our SE sciences factory on Nauvis orbit was somewhat chaotic:

#+caption: Space platform
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_space.png][file:old_space.jpg]]

This base is based on a main belt design, with one row/main belt per
series of space sciences. Fluid throughput and balancing became a
problem, and so did the transport of bulk items by robot (crashed robots
were slow to replenish). These will also be improved in /Endurance/.

Some attempts were made at a city block design on the top left, but the
complexity of SE space science recipes made it easier to just extend
each main belt.

To salvage what we could, we ended up adding a few dedicated rockets
carrying all the materials needed for some sciences. In particular you
can see the dedicated rockets on the left of the orange material science
line, and the bottom left rocket carrying naquium for the deep space
science line.

We are not entirely sure yet of how to make a cleaner variant of this,
but it will likely involve some space trains and a few more dedicated
rockets from the start.

*Planet outposts*

A typical output is the one we made for vitamelange.

#+caption: Remote base
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:old_remote_base.png][file:old_remote_base.jpg]]

Most basic resources (except oil and uranium) are mined on other planets
or the asteroid belt. The SE resources (e.g.Â vulcanite) are first
crushed at the source and then shipped to Nauvis to be further processed
with production and speed modules. All these outposts as well as Nauvis
orbit are supplied by about two dozen cargo rocket silos in two city
blocks. Unlike what some other folks seem to do, our outposts are very
minimalistic: we have a single 100x100 blueprint containing a landing
and launch pad. Fuel and other resources are always flown in from
Nauvis. For each resource we picked the planet with the highest yield
and started mining the largest ore patches (10M-100M). It turned out
that for most resources (except iron, copper, and vulcanite) this may
have been unnecessary as they never ran out.

At some point we had too many remote planets, so we needed a second
field of rocket launch pads to keep all sites stocked on solid rocket
fuel.

*Energy* We have mostly been using solar panels only. The SE solar panel
upgrades make it convenient to replace the vanilla panels by much better
ones, and it's just much simpler to copy paste fields of solar panels
than to design nuclear power plants and get all the water flowing.

* Mods
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mods
   :END:
Apart from Space Exploration itself and its dependencies, we are using
the following /QoL/ (Quality of Life) mods: - Todo List: keep track of
what needs to be done. - Auto Deconstruct: mark miners without resources
for deconstruction. - Helmod: factory planning. - Max Rate Calculator:
factory planning in hindsight, useful to measure actual throughput. -
What is it really used for?: find out in which recipes an item is used.
Useful to know whether or not to put items on the main belt or not. -
Module inserter: remotely insert modules using robots. - Upgrade Builder
and Planner: upgrade normal rail to space rail and back, which cannot be
done using the vanilla upgrade planner.

* /Endurance/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: endurance
   :END:
Now that we have given an overview of the previous base, let's move on
to /Endurance/ itself!

** Red & Green sciences
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: red-green-sciences
    :END:
Let's have a look at the initial red and green science factory. For the
very early game, We decided to go with a simple assembler grid setup.
This isn't very flexible, but very easy to build.

#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:base.png][file:base.jpg]]

As you can see, it also makes for simple upgrading to speed up
production when the better assemblers and inserters are researched. To
keep things simple, I didn't want to belt any items other than plates.
Because of this, inserters and belts have to be manually moved to the
green science assemblers every once in a while. It's not optimal, but
good enough for as long as it lasts since we will soon migrate the green
and red science production to larger factories.

** City Block Planning
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: city-block-planning
    :END:
It's never too early to start thinking about city blocks! One lesson we
learned from last time is to make sure that roboports are aligned with
the origin, so that rotating blueprints doesn't cause issues. We made a
50x50 blueprint with a roboport at one of the corners.

#+caption: Roboport blueprint
#+attr_html: :class inset
[[file:roboport.png][file:roboport.jpg]]

Next, we can already put down the edges of the first city blocks, so we
can design everything with these in mind. Following Nilaus, we put down
criss-crossing "Sacred Paths" to mark the boundaries of blocks. We
decided to keep the crash site as a historical monument, so a central
100x100 square was cut out and dedicated to this. This slightly
complicates things, but it's nice to keep this central area a bit
special.

[[file:cityblocks.png][file:cityblocks.jpg]]

Next time, we'll migrate red and green science to dedicated belt systems
(which can already be seen in the lower left of the map), and add black
and blue science packs into the mix!
