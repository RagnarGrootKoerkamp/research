Let's quickly go over some settings you can change for a better dark
mode experience in Chromium.

* Chromium theme
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: chromium-theme
     :END:
First of all, you can make Chromium itself use a dark theme. This will
ensure both a dark tab bar and nice dark settings pages. As explained
[[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1159741/enable-dark-mode-on-chromes-internal-pages][here]],
you'll need to change the following:

- Run =chromium= with the flags

  #+begin_example
  chromium --enable-features=WebUIDarkMode --force-dark-mode
  #+end_example

  If you are already using other feature flags, they can be comma
  separated:

  #+begin_example
  --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,WebUIDarkMode
  #+end_example

- In the browser settings, make sure the Theme (under Appearance) is set
  to Classic.

* Dark Reader
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dark-reader
     :END:
[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh][Dark
Reader]] is the extension of choice for inverting web pages. I'm
currently using the =Dynamic= theme.

You can bind keyboard shortcuts to toggle the extension and to
enable/disable the extension on specific sites.

* Vimium

[[https://github.com/philc/vimium][Vimium]] adds Vim-like bindings to
Chromium.

Currently there is [[https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/3797][an
issue]] where it shows a big bright white box when using the dark theme
on GitHub. As indicated in
[[https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/3732#issuecomment-749997600][this
comment]], the fix is to clone the vimium repo and edit the file
=content_scripts/vimium.css= by adding the following at the end:

#+begin_src css
.vimiumUIComponentVisible {
  color-scheme: light;
}
#+end_src

Then install Vimium from source using the instructions
[[https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-source][here]].

To algo get rid of the white omnibar, I'm using the
[[https://github.com/ysjn/vimium-simply-dark][Simply Dark]] theme.
Simply copy the contents of the =css= file into the =CSS for Vimium UI=
field in the advanced vimium options. To get rid of the animations,
delete the =animation:= in the =#vomnibar= block and the
=@keyframes show= block right below.
