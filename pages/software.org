For all my projects, feel free to create issues and/or reach out for help in
using them. My work is more on algorithm development
rather than direct bioinformatics applications, and so I appreciate getting in
contact with potential users :)

*Foundational Crates:*
- [[https://github.com/rust-seq/packed-seq][*packed_seq*]]: Slowly growing library for managing 2-bit encoded =ACTG= DNA sequences.
- [[https://github.com/rust-seq/simd-minimizers][*simd-minimizers*]]: SIMD-based implementation of random minimizers.
  - Builds on =packed_seq=.
  - No good support yet for non-=ACTG= characters.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/cacheline-ef][*cacheline_ef*]]: Elias-Fano encoding, one cacheline at a time.

*Libraries & Tools:*
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/astar-pairwise-aligner][*A*PA2*]]: Global pairwise alignment based on SIMD, bitpacking, and band-doubling
  - Reliable, but only supports =ACTG= input.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/PtrHash][*PtrHash*]]: A fast minimal perfect hash function.
  - Reliable, but randomized construction remains slightly annoying.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/simd-sketch][*simd-sketch*]]: SIMD-based bottom and bucket sketches.
  - Status: basic version done; could use polishing.
  - Builds on =simd-minimizers=.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sassy][*Sassy*]]: SIMD-based approximate string matching
  - Status: in development.
  - Search short (~32, or up to 1kbp) patterns in long texts.
  - Supports =ACTG=, IUPAC, and ASCII.


*Experimental Research Projects:*
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/minimizers][*Minimizers*]]: reference implementations and experiments for minimizer and sampling
  schemes.
