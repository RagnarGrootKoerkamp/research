For all my projects, feel free to create issues and/or reach out for help in
using them. My work is more on algorithm development
rather than direct bioinformatics applications, and so I appreciate getting in
contact with potential users :)

* Tools
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sassy][*Sassy*]], with [[http://github.com/rickbeeloo/][Rick Beeloo]] [cite:@sassy-preprint]:
  
  SIMD-based approximate string matching
  - Status: done.
  - Search short (10-100, or up to 1kbp) patterns in long texts.
  - Supports =ACTG=, IUPAC, and ASCII.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/astar-pairwise-aligner][*A*PA2*]], with [[https://github.com/pesho-ivanov][Pesho Ivanov]] [cite:@astarpa;@astarpa2]:

  Global pairwise alignment based on SIMD, bitpacking, and band-doubling
  - Reliable, but only supports =ACTG= input.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/simd-sketch][*simd-sketch*]]:
  
  SIMD-based bottom and bucket sketches.
  - Status: basic version done; needs polishing.
  - Builds on =seq-hash=.
- [[https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/mim][*mim*]], with [[https://github.com/rob-p][Rob Patro]] [cite:@mim-preprint]:
  
  a small auxiliary =.mim= index alongside =.fastx.gz=
  files for multi-threaded decompression.

** Tools building on this
- [[https://github.com/bede/deacon][*Deacon*]], by [[http://github.com/bede][Bede Constantinides]] [cite:@deacon-preprint]:
  Fast read filtering/decontamination. Builds on simd-minimizers.
- [[https://github.com/rickbeeloo/barbell][*Barbell*]], by [[http://github.com/rickbeeloo/][Rick Beeloo]] [cite:@barbell-preprint]:
  Fast demultiplexing. Builds on sassy.

* Libraries
- [[https://crates.io/crates/pa-types][*pa_types*]]: type definitions for pairwise alignment coordinates, and [[https://docs.rs/pa-types/1.2.0/pa_types/cigar/struct.Cigar.html][=Cigar=]] utilities.
  
** DNA bitpacking
Crates using 2-bit packed sequence representations and SIMD algorithms on top of them.
All developed together with [[https://github.com/imartayan/][Igor Martayan]] as part of simd-minimizers [cite:@simd-minimizers].
- [[https://github.com/rust-seq/packed-seq][*packed_seq*]]: Slowly growing library for managing 2-bit encoded =ACTG= DNA sequences.
  - Also supports 2+1 bit encoding to indicate ambiguous (N) characters.
- [[https://github.com/rust-seq/seq-hash][*seq-hash*]]: Streams over all nt-hashes (or other hashes) of a packed sequences.
- [[https://github.com/rust-seq/simd-minimizers][*simd-minimizers*]]: compute minimizers of a sequence.
  - Supports skipping over ambiguous windows.

* Data structures
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/cacheline-ef][*cacheline_ef*]]: Elias-Fano encoding, one cacheline at a time. Part of PtrHash.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/PtrHash][*PtrHash*]] [cite:@ptrhash]: A fast minimal perfect hash function.

* Experimental/incomplete
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/minimizers][*Minimizers*]]: reference implementations and experiments for minimizer and sampling
  schemes.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sshash-rs][*sshash-rs*]]: quick but incomplete reimplementation of SSHash.
- [[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/static-search-tree][*suffix array searching*]] ([[file:../posts/static-search-tree/static-search-tree.org][blog]]): static search trees are faster than binary search.
