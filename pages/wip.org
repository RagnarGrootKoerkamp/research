* Dormant
- *Minimizers*:
  - publish the anti-lex scheme?
  - continue investigation of greedymini to develop 'understandable' equivalent schemes.
  - Find exact optimal schemes for all $k\equiv 1\pmod w$
  - lower bound for local schemes

Code:
- *sshash-rs* ([[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sshash-rs][gh]])
- *suffix array searching* ([[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/static-search-tree][gh]], [[../posts/static-search-tree/static-search-tree.org][post]]) [cite:@sacabench]
  
* Long term plans
If anything here interests you, feel free to reach out for collaborations.

- *engineer STPD* [cite:@stpd]: write a highly optimized implementation.
  - minimizer space?
  - fuzzy version by only using minimizer start positions?
- *Optimal CPU/memory performance* given 3D latency and cooling constraints.
- *Pairwise alignment review paper* based on thesis chapter 2 ([[../../posts/pairwise-alignment][this post]]).
  - *Review on approximate string matching*, [[../posts/approximate-string-matching/approximate-string-matching.org][this post]] (will never happen).
- *Minimizers review paper* based on thesis part 2 ([[../../posts/minimizers][this post]]).

* Abandoned
- *Affine A*PA2*: too much of an overhaul.
- *Spaced $k$-mer similarity*: see [[file:../posts/spaced-kmer-distance.org][this post]].
- *Expected linear time A*PA*: see a draft in [[file:../posts/linear-time-pa/linear-time-pa.org][this post]].
- *Linear memory WFA*:  Instead of storing furthest reaching points
  for all wavefronts, it is sufficient to only store /critical/ points where
  paths split/merge.  This should lower memory usage of WFA to close to linear,
  without needing BiWFA. See [[../posts/linear-memory-wfa/linear-memory-wfa.org][this post]]. This has similar vibes to TALCO [cite:@talco].
- *Local doubling*: see [[../posts/local-doubling/local-doubling.org][this post]].
