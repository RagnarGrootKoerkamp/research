Here I list projects that I am working/have worked on. Outdated almost always.
Mostly as a note-to-self to keep things a bit organised.

* In progress (October 2025)
Algorithm engineering (with Peter Sanders' group @ KIT):
- *QuickHeap* ([[../posts/quickheap/quickheap.org][blog]]): a fast SIMD-based heap
- *k-perfect hashing*: quickly map keys to bins of size of $k\in \{8,16\}$,
  mostly extending PtrHash.
- *Static hash sets* (=StaticHashSet<u32>=) with single-cache-miss lookups
- Fast *2-bit rank* for use in =bwa-mem=, with Heng Li.

Tool/library development (with Igor Martayan & Bede Constantinides):
- Updated *packed-seq* ([[https://github.com/rust-seq/packed-seq][gh]]), *seq-hash* ([[https://github.com/rust-seq/seq-hash][gh]]), *simd-minimizers* ([[https://github.com/rust-seq/simd-minimizers/][gh]])
  - Faster handling of short-read data
  - Support for N characters using 2+1bit encoding
  - simd-mini: skip minimizers of windows containing N and other non-ACGT chars.
- *Paraseq* ([[https://github.com/noamteyssier/paraseq][gh]]) PRs:
  - multithreaded unzipping for paired-end input
  - new =ParallelReader= API
  - overall cleanup and deduplication
- *Deacon* ([[https://github.com/bede/deacon][gh]]):
  - speedups from dependencies above
  - more reusing of allocations
  - faster hashset WIP
  - faster IO and on-disk format

Furthermore:
- *Simd-Sketch* ([[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/simd-sketch][gh]], [[../posts/simd-sketch/simd-sketch.org][blog]]):
  - algorithm engineering for fast bottom & bucket sketching
  - TODO: algorithm engineering for fast bottom-sketch distance comparison
  - SIMD for fast bucket-sketch distances
  - experiments (sketch time, comparison time, correlation)
    - 1-bit hashing with many hashes is best
  - WIP: applications/integration with [[https://github.com/karel-brinda/attotree][attotree]] (by Karel Břinda) and [[https://github.com/bacpop/sketchlib.rust][sketchlib]]
    (by John Lees)
  - TODO: fix bias due to 32-bit hash collisions.
  - TODO?: locality sensitive clustering; phylogeny reconstruction
- *NtHash collisions* ([[file:../posts/nthash2-collisions.org][blog]]), with John Lees and Victor Bouza.

Further collaborations (external involvement / supervision):
- Theory: *$O(n\lg n)$ chaining* for anchored edit distance, with Nicola Rizzo.
# - ([[https://www.overleaf.com/project/68bd6809d64fe90ec1d4eacf][private overleaf]])
- Software: *Barbell* ([[https://github.com/rickbeeloo/barbell][gh]]): fast & accurate demultiplexing, with Rick Beeloo.
# - Extending *A*Map*, with Sebastian Schmidt.
# - Bringing *Sassy* to practice, with Kornel Labun.

* Upcoming conference dates & deadlines

* Dormant
- *Sassy* [cite:@sassy-preprint]: under review.
- *Minimizers*:
  - publish the anti-lex scheme?
  - continue investigation of greedymini to develop 'understandable' equivalent schemes.
  - Find exact optimal schemes for all $k\equiv 1\pmod w$
  - lower bound for local schemes

Code:
- *sshash-rs* ([[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sshash-rs][gh]])
- *suffix array searching* ([[https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/static-search-tree][gh]], [[../posts/static-search-tree/static-search-tree.org][post]]) [cite:@sacabench]
  
* Done
See [[./publications.org][publications]].

* Long term plans
If anything here interests you, feel free to reach out for collaborations.

- *engineer STPD* [cite:@stpd]: write a highly optimized implementation.
  - minimizer space?
  - fuzzy version by only using minimizer start positions?
- *Optimal CPU/memory performance* given 3D latency and cooling constraints.
- *Pairwise alignment review paper* based on thesis chapter 2 ([[../../posts/pairwise-alignment][this post]]).
  - *Review on approximate string matching*, [[../posts/approximate-string-matching/approximate-string-matching.org][this post]] (will never happen).
- *Minimizers review paper* based on thesis part 2 ([[../../posts/minimizers][this post]]).

* Abandoned
- *Affine A*PA2*: too much of an overhaul.
- *Spaced $k$-mer similarity*: see [[file:../posts/spaced-kmer-distance.org][this post]].
- *Expected linear time A*PA*: see a draft in [[file:../posts/linear-time-pa/linear-time-pa.org][this post]].
- *Linear memory WFA*:  Instead of storing furthest reaching points
  for all wavefronts, it is sufficient to only store /critical/ points where
  paths split/merge.  This should lower memory usage of WFA to close to linear,
  without needing BiWFA. See [[../posts/linear-memory-wfa/linear-memory-wfa.org][this post]]. This has similar vibes to TALCO [cite:@talco].
- *Local doubling*: see [[../posts/local-doubling/local-doubling.org][this post]].
