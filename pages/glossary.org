This is a growing list of ambiguous terms and their definitions.
More of a place to store random remarks than a complete reference for now.

- diagonal transition :: name introduced by [cite/text:@navarro01]

- approximate ::
  1. /approximate algorithm/: an algorithms that does not always give the
     /correct/ answer.
  2. /$k$-approximate string matching/: variant semi-global alignment where we
     find all matches of a pattern in a reference with at most $k$ mistakes.

     Also /approximate string matching/: alternative name for global pairwise alignment.

- dynamic heuristic :: A heuristic that changes as the A* progresses. Not:
  /online heuristic/.

- heuristic ::
  1. /A* heuristic/: A function $h$ that provides a lower bound (when
     /admissible/) on the distance from the current state to the end.
  2. /heuristic method/: An approximate method, that approximates the exact answer.

- exact ::
  1. An /exact algorithm/ is guaranteed to give the correct (e.g. minimal) answer.
  2. An /exact match/ between strings, without errors.

- optimal ::
  1. /exact/, guaranteed correct.
  2. /optimal performance/complexity/: as fast as (theoretically) possible

- complexity ::
  1. /(asymptotic) runtime complexity/: how the runtime of an algorithm scales
     with input size, as in $O(n^2)$.
  2. /not simple, but difficult/: a more informal statement.

- vertex / node / state ::
  All are used interchangeably, but have slightly different meanings:
  - /vertex/: The objects of a graph between which the edges go. The most
    'mathematical'/precise of the three.
  - /node/: Same as /vertex/, but can additionally mean a /node in a
    data structure/ or a /node in a tree/. More general and hence slightly less precise when
    /vertex/ could also be used.
  - /state/: Usually in relation to a /state machine/.
  In A*PA, we use /state/ exclusively for a vertex of the /edit-graph/, and
  use /node/ instead of /vertex/, mostly because it's shorter.

- seed ::
  1. An arbitrary $k$mer, as in MinHash and spaced $k$mer methods.
  2. A /substring/ of $A$ when doing pairwise alignment.
  3. As in /seed-and-extend/, a /match/: a substring of $A$ that /matches/ somewhere to a substring of
     $B$.

- significant ::
  1. /a significant result/: the result passed a statistical test
  2. /a significant speedup/: (informal) much faster

- average / expected / mean ::
  - /mean/: a statistic of a set of real numbers.
  - /average/: the mean, or 'common case' of some sample.
  - /expected/: the expected value of a random variable.
